# Formatting


## Text formatting in FusionReactor

Text formatting plays a crucial role in how users interpret and interact with our product. Proper use of formatting enhances readability, guides user attention, and improves overall user experience in FusionReactor's UI and documentation.

### Basics

* **Bold text** is used to improve scannability in the UI and emphasize key points in longer texts. In FusionReactor, use bold to highlight important metrics, action items, or critical information.

* *Italic text* is often used for contextual hints under input elements and can convey a focused or subdued tone. In FusionReactor, use italics for brief explanations or to indicate variable names in text.

* Underlined text in UI is typically interpreted as a link. Avoid using underlines for non-clickable text to prevent confusion. In FusionReactor, reserve underlines exclusively for hyperlinks.

### Code Formatting

When presenting code snippets or configuration examples in FusionReactor documentation or UI, format them using a monospace font. This improves readability and distinguishes code from regular text.

```java
String example = "This is a FusionReactor configuration example";
```

### Lists

Proper list formatting enhances clarity and readability in FusionReactor's documentation and UI:

* Capitalize the first letter of each list item.
* Use unordered (bullet) lists for general information or feature sets.
* Use ordered (numbered) lists for step-by-step instructions or prioritized items.

Example:

1. Install FusionReactor agent
2. Configure your application server
3. Start monitoring your application

### Additional FusionReactor-Specific Guidelines

* Use consistent formatting for FusionReactor-specific terms (e.g., always write "FusionReactor" as one word with a capital 'F' and 'R').
* When referring to UI elements, use bold text (e.g., Navigate to the **Dashboard** section).
* For metric names or specific data points, use `code formatting` (e.g., The `response_time` metric indicates...).

Remember, consistent formatting across FusionReactor's UI and documentation helps users quickly understand and navigate our product, enhancing their overall experience.
