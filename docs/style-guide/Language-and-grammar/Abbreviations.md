# FusionReactor Abbreviation and Acronym Guide

Abbreviations and acronyms are shortened forms of words or phrases, used to conserve space and improve readability. In FusionReactor documentation, they should be used judiciously and consistently.

## General Rules

1. On first use, spell out the full term followed by the acronym in parentheses. Example: "FusionReactor (FR) is a powerful application monitoring tool."
2. Capitalize spelled-out acronyms only if they contain proper nouns (e.g., product names, team names).
3. Always abbreviate units of measurement unless otherwise specified.
4. Spell out common words like "average" instead of abbreviating them, unless space is extremely limited.
5. For common word abbreviations:
   - Avoid using them at the beginning of a sentence.
   - Add a period after the abbreviation (e.g., "avg.").
6. For large numbers, spell out thousand, million, billion, trillion unless space is tight. If abbreviating, use: 30K, 30M, 30B, 30T.
7. Don't use apostrophes to make acronyms plural: "JVMs" not "JVM's".
