# Checking license seats and usage (On-Premise)

If you encounter a **“No seats available”** error when attempting to activate a FusionReactor on-premise instance, this means your license has reached its **seat limit**.

## Understanding license seats

Each FusionReactor license seat allows:

- ✅ Up to 4 instances per seat.
- ✅ All 4 instances must be on the same server (host).

If an instance is activated on a different host or if more than 4 instances are unintentionally launched on the same server, it can exceed your seat count and trigger this **“No seats available”** error.



## How to check license usage

### 1. Log in to the FusionReactor portal

Go to [app.fusionreactor.io](https://app.fusionreactor.io) and sign in with your account.

### 2. Access On-Premise Licensing

From the top navigation bar, click on **On Premise**.
