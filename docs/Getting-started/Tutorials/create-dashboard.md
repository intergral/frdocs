Dashboards and panels enable you to visually represent your data. To display a visualization within a panel, you must have at least one associated query.

## Before you start

* Ensure that you have the correct permissions.

* Understand the query language of the target data source. 

!!! example
	logql, promql or traceql

!!! info "Learn more"
	Read the [documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/visualizations/) for more information on other visualizations available, including examples.

## Setting up repeating rows

FusionReactor allows you to configure the addition of panels or rows to a dashboard dynamically, based on the value of a variable. These variables bring dynamic changes to your queries across all rows within the dashboard.

### Before you begin

Ensure that the query includes a multi-value variable.

### Configure repeating rows

**Step 1**: Click **Dashboards** in the left-side menu.

**Step 2**: Navigate to the dashboard you want to work on.

**Step 3**: At the top of the dashboard, click **Add** and select **Row** in the drop-down.

!!! info
	If the dashboard is empty, you can click the + Add row button in the middle of the dashboard.

**Step 4**: Hover over the row title and click the cog icon.

**Step 5**: In the **Row Options** dialog box, add a title and select the variable for which you want to add repeating rows.

**Step 6**: Click **Update**.

**Step 7**: To provide context to dashboard users, add the variable to the row title.

## Making a copy of existing dashboards

Making a copy of an existing dashboard and then editing it, rather than creating a new one from scratch can save valuable time.

**Step 1**: Navigate to the dashboard you wish to copy. For example, the Span Metrics dashboard.

**Step 2**: Click the **Dashboard settings**  icon.

**Step 3**: Select **Save as** to display the **Save dashboard copy** screen.

**Step 4**:  Change the name of dashboard in the **Dashboard name** box if required, and select **General** from **Folder** dropdown. 

**Step 5**: Click **Save**

## Editing a panel

After adding a panel to a dashboard, you can open it at any time to edit or update queries, add data transformation, and change visualization settings.

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/893744767?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="How to edit custom dashboards on FusionReactor - quick &amp; easy guide"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

**Step 1**: Open the dashboard that contains the panel you want to edit.

**Step 2**: Hover over any part of the panel to display the actions 
menu on the top right corner.

**Step 3**: Click the menu and select **Edit**.

!!! tip
	Keyboard shortcut: Hover over the panel and press e. The panel opens in edit mode.



## Moving a panel

**Step 1**: To relocate a panel, simply choose your desired dashboard location.

**Step 2**: Access the left-side menu and click on **Dashboards**.
 
**Step 3**: Find the dashboard you wish to modify.

**Step 4**: Click on the panel title, then drag and drop the panel to its new position.

## Resizing a panel

**Step 1**: Open the left-side menu and select **Dashboards**.

**Step 2**: Locate and select the dashboard you intend to edit.

**Step 3**: To adjust the panel's dimensions, click and drag the lower-right corner of the panel.

## Configure thresholds 

A threshold is a user-specified value associated with a metric, visually represented in a dashboard when the defined threshold is met or exceeded.

Thresholds offer a way to conditionally style and color visualizations based on query results. While not applicable to all visualizations, thresholds can be applied to various visualization types, including **Time-series**, **Stat**, **Gauge**, **Geomap**, **Table**, and **State timeline**.

!!! example
	You can utilize thresholds to achieve the following effects:

	* Color grid lines or grid areas in the **Time-series** visualization.

	* Color the background or value text in the **Stat** visualization.

	* Color the gauge and threshold markers in the **Gauge** visualization.

	* Color cell text or background in the **Table**  visualization.

There are two types of thresholds:

* **Absolute** thresholds, defined by a specific numeric value.

!!! example
	80 on a scale of 1 to 150.

* **Percentage** thresholds, defined relative to the minimum or maximum value.

!!! example
	80 percent.

**Default thresholds** are set by FusionReactor on visualizations that support them, with the following default values:

80 = <span style='color: red;'>red</span>

Base = <span style='color: green;'>green</span>

Mode = Absolute


The **Base** value represents minus infinity and typically corresponds to the **good** color.

### Add or delete thresholds
You can add or delete thresholds as needed. FusionReactor automatically sorts threshold values from highest to lowest.

#### To add a threshold

**Step 1** Edit the panel you want to add a threshold.

**Step 2** In the options side pane, locate the Thresholds section, and click + Add threshold.

**Step 3** Select a threshold color, number, and mode. The threshold mode applies to all thresholds on this panel.

!!! info
	For a time-series panel, choose a **Show thresholds** option.

#### To delete a threshold

**Step 1**: Navigate to the panel containing the threshold.

**Step 2**:  Click the trash icon next to the threshold you want to remove.

!!! info
	Deleting a threshold removes it from all visualizations that include the threshold.
