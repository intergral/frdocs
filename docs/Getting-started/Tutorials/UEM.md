## Enhancing user experience through FusionReactor's UEM 

**Problem:** Slow application response times and performance bottlenecks are negatively impacting user experience and satisfaction.

**Solution using FusionReactor:**

1.  **Install & set up User Experience Monitoring (UEM):**
    * Understand that UEM uses JavaScript embedded in your webpages to track user experience.
    * Follow the detailed installation and setup instructions provided [here](/frdocs/Data-insights/Features/UEM/User-Experience-Monitoring/#script-examples).
    * Ensure the JavaScript snippet is correctly implemented on the webpages you wish to monitor.

2.  **Monitor end-to-end transaction times with UEM:**
    * Access the **User Experience graph** within FusionReactor to visualize tracked user experiences.
    * Observe the load times from the user's browser to your ColdFusion application and back.
    * Analyze the **latency across all components** involved in the transaction, including:
        * Backend services.
        * Database queries.
        * External API calls.
    * Identify **slow endpoints** and recognize **performance trends** that are negatively affecting user experience.

3.  **Implement performance improvements based on UEM data:**
    * Based on the identified bottlenecks, implement appropriate performance optimizations. This may include:
        * **Optimizing ColdFusion code:** Refactor inefficient code segments.
        * **Improving database query efficiency:** Tune slow SQL queries (refer to the [Slow SQL Queries](/frdocs/Getting-started/Tutorials/resolve-slow-queries/) documentation).
        * **Reducing external service call latency:** Investigate and optimize interactions with external APIs or services.
        * **Optimizing data sent to the browser**
           

4.  **Validate & monitor enhancements:**
    * After implementing optimizations, **re-test the affected transactions** using UEM.
    * **Compare the User Experience Monitoring performance metrics** before and after the changes.
    * Verify that **response times have improved** and user experience has become smoother.
    * Set up **alerts within FusionReactor** to notify you of:
        * Slow response times.
        * Recurring performance issues.
    * **Continuously monitor key user experience indicators** to ensure ongoing performance and responsiveness.

5.  **Maintain continuous monitoring & proactive approach:**
    * Prioritize **fast and reliable application performance** to ensure a consistently excellent user experience.
    * **Proactively identify and address potential issues** before they impact users.
    * Use FusionReactor's UEM to maintain **continuous monitoring** of user experience.
    * Set up alerts to get notified of performance degradation.
