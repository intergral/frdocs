# Memory leak detection & analysis 

**Problem:** Memory leaks are causing application slowdowns, crashes, and poor user experience.

**Solution using FusionReactor:**

1.  **Detect memory leaks:**
    * Open FusionReactor (Cloud UI or On-Premise UI).
    * Monitor **heap usage trends** over time using the **memory metrics graphs** (Cloud) or **Memory Overview page** (On-Premise).
    * Pay attention to **garbage collection activity**.
    * Look for **unusual memory growth patterns** that indicate objects are not being garbage collected properly.
    * Identify any consistent increases in heap memory that do not return to baseline.

2.  **Analyze the root cause:**
    * If a potential leak is detected, investigate further using FusionReactor.
    * Analyze **thread activity** (On-Premise UI) to detect blocked or excessive memory-holding threads.
    * Use **[Crash Protection](/frdocs/Data-insights/Features/Crash-protection/Crash-Protection/)** to trigger Garbage Collection at key moments and observe the impact.
    * Take **heap dumps** and analyze them using third-party tools like **[Eclipse MAT](https://eclipse.dev/mat/)**.
    * Inspect the heap dump to identify **large or continuously growing objects** that are not being released.
    * Combine these analysis techniques to pinpoint the exact source of the leak, such as:
        * **Static collections** that retain objects indefinitely.
        * **Listeners** that are not properly unregistered.
        * **Caching issues** that lead to excessive memory consumption.

3.  **Resolve the issue:**
    * Apply the necessary fixes based on the identified root cause.
    * **Optimize object lifecycles** by removing unnecessary references and ensuring objects are released when no longer needed.
    * Address **code patterns** that cause memory retention, such as those mentioned above.
    * Adjust **JVM memory settings** and **garbage collection strategies** if necessary to better manage memory usage.
    * Implement code changes to release objects when they are no longer required.

4.  **Validate the fix:**
    * After applying the fixes, **re-check the memory metrics graphs** in FusionReactor.
    * Confirm that **heap usage has improved** and returned to expected levels.
    * Monitor **garbage collection behavior** to ensure memory pressure has been reduced.
    * Set up **Crash Protection alerts** for abnormal memory consumption trends to prevent future memory leaks.

5.  **Maintain continuous monitoring:**
    * Continuously monitor memory usage and garbage collection activity with FusionReactor.
    * Proactively address any potential memory leaks to ensure application stability and efficiency.
