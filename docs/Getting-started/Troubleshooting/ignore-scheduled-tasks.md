# How to ignore specific scheduled tasks in FusionReactor
 

Protection restrictions let you choose which pages the Protection system monitors or ignores. You can set this mode in the [Protection Settings](/frdocs/Data-insights/Features/Crash-protection/Settings/6).  

The **Restrictions page** has two sections:  
1. **Add New Restrictions** – Use the form at the top to enter new rules.  
2. **View Existing Restrictions** – Below the form, see a list of current restrictions.
