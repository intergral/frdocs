# Get started with FusionReactor 

Welcome to the FusionReactor APM platform! Our CFML monitoring tool provides deep visibility into your systems, helping you solve issues you may not have been aware of, regardless of the technology you use. FusionReactor offers numerous ways to enhance visibility, allowing you to monitor, troubleshoot, and improve digital performance. 
<br>
Here's a brief overview of our most popular capabilities and features.


## Alerting 

![Image title](../images/Getting-started/GSalert.png){ align=left width="350" height="250" } FusionReactor Alerting allows  you to create automated checks on the values of metric data gathered by a FusionReactor agent, and generate  alerts when user-made conditions are  met. <br>  Learn more about Alerting **[here](/Cloud/guides/dashboards/)**.

<br>

## Anomaly Detection

![Image title](../images/Getting-started/AD1.png){ align=right width="350" height="250" } Anomaly detection is an algorithmic capability designed to recognize instances when a metric displays behavior that diverges from its historical patterns.  <br>  Learn more about Anomaly Detection **[here](/Cloud/guides/dashboards/)**.


## Crash Protection

![Image title](../images/Getting-started/CrashP.png){ align=left width="350" height="250" } Crash Protection gives you the ability to alert when the application server is experiencing issues and prevent application servers from crashing.<br>  Learn more about Crash Protection **[here](/Cloud/guides/dashboards/)**.

#### FusionReactor Java Agent

With FusionReactor Cloud APM, you can diagnose both live and historic issues with our powerful metrics engine and dashboards.

Our APM goes beyond Java and ColdFusion to deliver a combination of metrics, profiles, logs, and code enabling you to quickly understand and diagnose issues on your application or your server'

    [FusionReactor Java Agent](/Getting-started/GSFRJA/)

!!! note
    Installing the agent also gives access to the On-Premise UI.

#### Observability Agent

Integrations allow you to ingest vital metrics to monitor the health of your entire infrastructure. Installing the Observability Agent, an [open source](https://github.com/intergral/observability-agent/releases) autoconfiguration and installation tool, allows you to export metrics, logs and OTel data from all aspects of your stack into the cloud, with no configuration required. The Observability Agent can detect which services are running on your machine, and automatically create a configuration file with integrations for detected services.


#### Instrument OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry is an open-source project created by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) consisting of APIs, SDKs, and tools to help developers create, monitor, and export their system data (metrics, traces, logs and more) to observability back-ends. We recommend installing the [Observability Agent](/Cloud/integrations/Metric-Integrations/) and adding the OTel component to allow receiving of traces, logs and metrics.

#### Kubernetes

Kubernetes (also known as K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The [Kubernetes-Prometheus-Stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack) is a deployable Helm chart which enables monitoring of Kubernetes clusters in FusionReactor Cloud. This stack is meant for cluster monitoring, so it is pre-configured to collect metrics from all Kubernetes components.
