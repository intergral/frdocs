## OpsPilot AI

OpsPilot AI is an advanced observability
solution that leverages generative AI to provide
powerful insights into the performance of your
applications. By combining real-time data
collection, predictive analytics, and natural
language queries, OpsPilot AI enables you to
identify and resolve issues before they occur,
optimize the performance of your applications,
and reduce downtime.


## Kubernetes cluster monitoring

Kubernetes allows developers to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications across a cluster of nodes, providing features such as load balancing, automatic scaling, self-healing, and rolling updates.

To make things easier for you, we have introduced Kubernetes monitoring in **FusionReactor Cloud**. With this tool, you can automate many of the manual tasks and focus on getting the most out of your Kubernetes monitoring.



## Observability Agent

The Observability Agent, an [open source](https://github.com/intergral/observability-agent/releases) autoconfiguration and installation tool, is a wrapper for the [Grafana Agent](https://github.com/grafana/agent) that can install the agent,
detect which services are running on your machine, and automatically create a configuration file with integrations for detected services.



## Usage based billing

As a complete observability solution, our usage-based billing plan meets your needs in a diverging technical space and we pride ourselves on offering essential observability at sensible prices. 

## Distributed tracing

We are excited to announce the addition of a new distributed tracing within FusionReactor.  Distributed tracing is a method used in observability to track the flow of requests as they move through a distributed system. It allows you to see a detailed view of the entire request flow, from the time the request was initiated to the time it was completed.  

FusionReactor captures and displays this trace information in a graphical format, so you can visualize the entire request flow and quickly identify any issues or bottlenecks. 



## Log management

Since the release of FusionReactor 9, we are able to ingest and index any log file using [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/).


FusionReactor uses this powerful capability to make it easy to analyze and track system events. We can also automatically link logs to other events such as distributed traces or errors, providing a complete picture of system activity. This makes investigating problems and identifying issues much faster and more efficient which improves overall performance and reliability.



## Span metrics 

FusionReactor has several new **Span Metrics** dashboards which provide detailed insight into specific parts of a distributed trace through the use of spans. Spans are essentially small pieces of time that represent a specific operation or action within a larger process or transaction. 

Measuring span duration and status codes  allows developers to quickly identify bottlenecks and problem areas in their application's distributed architecture. 
 
With the ability to view 90th and 99th percentile span duration, developers can easily determine areas that need improvement and take action to optimize performance. This new capability is a powerful tool for improving application performance and providing better visibility into distributed architectures.
