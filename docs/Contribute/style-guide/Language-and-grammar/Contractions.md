# Contractions in FusionReactor Documentation

Contractions can make FusionReactor documentation more approachable and user-friendly. Use them judiciously to balance professionalism with accessibility.

## Guidelines

1. Use common contractions where they feel natural, especially in user guides, tutorials, and less formal documentation.
2. Maintain a more formal tone in technical specifications, API documentation, or official reports by limiting contractions.
3. Be consistent within each document or section.
4. Avoid uncommon or unnatural-sounding contractions.

## Examples

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| We've updated FusionReactor with new features. | We have updated FusionReactor with new features. |
| You'll see the performance metrics in the dashboard. | You will see the performance metrics in the dashboard. |
| If there are 4 or more errors, an alert's triggered. | If there are 4 or more errors, an alert is triggered. |
| FR's designed to optimize your application monitoring. | FR is designed to optimize your application monitoring. |

## Avoid

- Don't use contractions in critical warnings or error messages.
- Avoid contractions that might confuse non-native English speakers or new users.

## FusionReactor-Specific Usage

- In product introductions: 
  > "FusionReactor's your go-to tool for application performance monitoring."

- In quick-start guides: 
  > "Let's set up your first FR instance."

- In feature descriptions: 
  > "You're able to track real-time metrics with our advanced dashboards."

- In troubleshooting sections: 
  > "If you're experiencing high latency, here's what to check."

- In update notifications: 
  > "We've added new OpenTelemetry integrations in this release."

Remember, the goal is to make FusionReactor documentation accessible while maintaining its professional tone. Use contractions to enhance readability, but prioritize clarity and precision, especially in technical content.
