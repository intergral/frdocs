# FusionReactor Style Guide

When writing for the FusionReactor UI, we follow consistent guidelines to ensure clarity and maintain our brand voice. This section addresses frequently asked questions and highlights key elements of our style.

## Our tone of voice

FusionReactor has a distinct voice that we use across all our communication channels: in the product, documentation, messaging, and sales material.

We use American English and write in a way that's **precise**, **empowering**, and **innovative**.

We aim to sound like a knowledgeable colleague. We're clear, optimistic, intuitive, and forward-thinking.

## Writing Tips

* Use a professional yet approachable tone, avoiding overly formal language.
* Use pronouns and contractions where appropriate to maintain a conversational feel.
* Address the reader directly.
* Explain complex concepts clearly and concisely, minimizing unnecessary jargon.
* Focus on the user benefits of each feature or action.
* Present the value to the user first, then explain how to achieve it.
* Don't hesitate to use technical terms when necessary, but always provide clear context.

## Examples

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Monitor transactions of all types, from API calls to database queries. | FusionReactor collects and reports information on various transaction types. |
| Use alerts to track performance issues and system events. | An alert notifies designated personnel about performance issues and system events through FusionReactor's alerting system. |
| Optimize your application performance with real-time metrics and advanced analytics. | FusionReactor's real-time metrics and advanced analytics reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) by correlating application performance with system configurations. |

## Language and Spelling

* Use American spelling consistently.
  - Example: "Optimize the license usage."
* Avoid region-specific idioms or phrases that may not be universally understood.

Remember, our goal is to communicate clearly and effectively, helping our users leverage FusionReactor to its full potential.
