The CPU Sampler. This tool can be
used to track down the CPU usage of every instantiated thread on the
server. Additionally, there are tools provided to use this information
in a comprehensive way, thereby detecting any inefficient processes on
your server. Note: this feature, just like every Profiler feature,
requires a **FusionReactor Ultimate** or **FusionReactor Developer**
license.

## CPU Usage Monitoring

The CPU Sampler is a new feature in FusionReactor 7.1. This feature
retrieves and collects all live system thread data and their respective
metadata. This includes: thread IDs, thread names, thread groups, thread
states and critical CPU timing.

### Overview

Sample information is given at the top left, this data relates to the
current sample being processed:

-   JVM Start Time: the time the Java Virtual Machine was initialized.
-   Threads: the number of threads the sampler is currently watching.
-   Total CPU Time (ms): The collective amount, to millisecond
    precision, of each thread's CPU time.

The Deltas button will render an aggregate of each thread's CPU time
since the button was pressed until the last page refresh. The deltas
feature is explained more under the Sampler section below.

The Snapshots button will create a real-time export of the Sampler for
later inspection or comparisons, see [CPU
Snapshots](#cpu-snapshots) for more about this.

### Filtering

At the top right, the user is presented with a familiar tool: the filter
table. Except this does not filter packages, it filters thread names. In
the image above, the thread name Finalizer is added to the filter list.
This means any thread with the name "Finalizer" will be omitted from the
view.

### Sampler

The sampler will retrieve all active threads and their CPU information
since the Java Virtual Machine started. Alongside this, it will also
render the live state the thread is in. This data will be updated at
every page refresh.

The Deltas feature in the CPU Sampler is an incredibly useful feature.
Once delta values are tracked, they can provide the user with the
current CPU usage since the button was clicked till the current time. A
reset button will appear once Deltas is pressed – clicking this button
will allow you to set a new time (baseline) from where the thread CPU
time is calculated.

To assess the performance of certain CPU-heavy threads the user can sort
the table by highestThread CPUTime (%). The more expensive threads will
then be filtered to the top. The Thread CPU Time % is the percentage of
that particular thread's CPU usage against the total CPU time of all
running threads. From there, users can take further action to speed up
their server using preexisting FusionReactor tools, such as:

-   Get a stack trace of the thread
-   Kill the thread
-   Profile the thread
-   Pause the thread

Threads that are blocked will become highlighted on the page like the
image below.

##  CPU Snapshots

Snapshots provide CPU Sampler information at the exact moment of
capture. Multiple CPU Snapshots can be taken and stored in
FusionReactor.

Snapshots can be taken at any moment during the execution of a sample,
this is achieved by the 'Take Snapshot' button.

It is important to note: unlike the Heap View, these snapshots are
volatile and are not stored on disk. This means restarting FusionReactor
will lead to losing any cached snapshots.

### Snapshot View

By selecting to view a certain snapshot, you are redirected to a very
familiar page. This page is essentially identical to the CPU Sampling
page at the moment the snapshot was taken.

### Diff View

To view compare two unique samples, select only two check-boxes on the
CPU Snapshots page and click the 'Diff Selected' button. This will then
generate the page shown below.

This is another helpful tool, as it can describe the changes in thread
execution over a period of time. This page will render the inner-join
difference between the left and right snapshots' threads.

Thread names can also be filtered on this page, just like the live CPU
Sampler.

What am I looking at?

-   The two selected snapshots are identified by either 'Left' or
    'Right', they have their own respective columns and color scheme.
-   The Left / Right Diffs table shows the general differences between
    snapshots e.g. differences in thread count between the left and
    right snapshot.
-   On the right is the filters table.
-   The table below then describes the change in CPU time between
    sampled threads.

The change in CPU time is very similar to the live deltas view in the
CPU Sampler, however with this the user is not required to actively
monitor the information. The user can take snapshots in different time
periods and deviate from there any changes in thread time. For instance,
lets say the left snapshot was taken two hours ago and the right was
taken very recently, any threads that have a large delta value have had
an increased processing load on the CPU.

Threads that have changed names between snapshots will be rendered with
both names under Thread Name.

## Troubleshooting

On certain machines, the CPU Sampler might return an error page like
this:

[![](/attachments/245552711/245552718.png)](/attachments/245552711/245552718.png)

There are several cases where an error page will be returned:

-   Unsupported Java Version – this is when FusionReactor is installed
    on a system with an unsupported Java Runtime Environment (anything
    below Java 6).
-   Unsupported Java Management Extension – this is thrown when the JVM
    vendor does not support thread CPU timing. To fix this, run
    FusionReactor in a supported JVM.
-   Disabled Thread CPU Time – the sampler uses a Java Management
    Extension to capture a thread's special meta information. This error
    page is rendered when the thread CPU timing within this extension is
    disabled. This can be resolved by following these steps:

1.  1.  Go to Metrics → JMX MBeans
    2.  Click on java.lang
    3.  Click on Threading
    4.  Set the boolean value of ThreadCpuTimeEnabled to true


It is important to note that that performance in some Java Virtual
Machine implementations could be affected by setting this parameter to
true. This does not apply to the aforementioned Hotspot JVM.
