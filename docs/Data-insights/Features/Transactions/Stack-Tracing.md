# Stack Tracing

## Introduction

**Stack traces** provide information on the threads at a specific point in
time. The top of each thread shows the header.

## Thread header

The header appears at the top of each stack trace for each thread. The
header colors matches the thread state.

The headers format is

    "Thread Name" Id='Thread Id' STATE <lock info>

-   **Thread name** is the verbose text name of the thread.
-   **Id** is the unique thread id.
-   **STATE** is the thread state as seen by the Java JVM.
-   **lock info** shows which monitor locks the thread is currently waiting
    or blocking on.

## Stack trace

This is shown through the various methods and code lines that have been
executed. The stack trace consists of single frames and each frame shows
the class, method and (if available) line number of the code which
called the next frame, or in which code is currently execution.

The stack traces in FusionReactor are are displayed in two formats: **Rich** and **Plain**

-   Clicking on the **blue** class name opens up the [decompile](../UI/Overview.md#decompilation) code
    for the specific class.

-   Clicking on the **red** method name opens up the [decompile](../UI/Overview.md#decompilation) code
    for the method, or methods if there are more than one method with
    the same name, of the specific class.

-   Clicking on the **green** file name or line number opens up the
    New Breakpoint dialog with the information from the stack trace
    location prefilled. 


With **FusionReactor** it is possible to [decompile](../UI/Overview.md#decompilation) both Java and CFML (cfc
and cfm files). If **FusionReactor** has access to the CFML code we will
display the cfm or cfc file as it is stored on disk, however if
**FusionReactor** has no access to the code decompiled Java code for your
CFML will be displayed. Allowing **FusionReactor** access to the application
code can be configured in [Debug Sources](../Debugger/Sources.md)

## Debug


This is only available in **FusionReactor Ultimate Edition**.

With the introduction of the **Production Debugger** in **FusionReactor** 6,
Stack Traces have also been given an extra feature to create breakpoints
directly for a source file by clicking on it in the Stack Trace:

It is also possible to create a trigger directly for a Request that
failed due to an **Exception**, from the **Request Detail** page:

## Locks

Locks are best explained by an example. Imagine 2 threads, Thread
"http-nio-8080-exec-6" with ID 81 and another thread
"http-nio-8080-exec-7" with ID 82. If thread 81 acquires a lock (of type
java.lang.Object and hash code 0x77a224c4) which thread 82 also needs,
thread 82 will have to wait thread 81 to release it.

Thread 81 will have the following shown in the stack trace at the
location where its acquired the lock.

    - locked <0x77a224c4> (a java.lang.Object)

Where Thread 82 needs to use the lock and waits for it to be released
from thread 81 it shows the following in the stack trace

    - waiting on <0x77a224c4> (a java.lang.Object held by thread 82, http-nio-8080-exec-7)

### Locked

Locked means that the thread has ownership of the object with hash code
0x77a224c4, in this case a java.lang.Object.  While this thread owns the
lock, no other thread can have it, blocking them from entering this
portion of code (often a function).

### Waiting on

Waiting means that the thread is waiting for the object with hash code
0x77a224c4, in this case a java.lang.Object. 

### Lock filter

By clicking on a lock link, the page is redirected to the **Stack Trace
All Threads** and a filter is applied so that only threads that have
either acquired or are waiting on a chosen lock are shown. A banner is
displayed at the top of the page to show this. 

!!! example 
    A lock link is shown below: <br>
    [![](/frdocs/attachments/245550463/245550503.png)](/frdocs/attachments/245550463/245550503.png)

!!! info 
    Lock links are available from any page showing locks (Stack Traces, Debug Frames, Profiles).

## Thread / Transaction table

For each thread, along with the stack traces in **FusionReactor**, are the
thread details.  The thread details table shows information about the
thread as well as some limited information about the active request.

!!! example 
    A blocked thread running the synchronised\_released.jsp test page.
    [![](/frdocs/attachments/245550463/245550513.png)](/frdocs/attachments/245550463/245550513.png)

The table shows the following information:

|Column Name|Description of the value|
|--- |--- |
|**Trace Time**|The time the stack trace was generated|
|**Request ID**|The request ID if the active request (if one is active for the thread)|
|**Description**|The description from the active request (if one is active for the thread)|
|**Started**|The start time of the active request (if one is active for the thread)|
|**Duration**|The current duration of the active request (if one is active for the thread)|
|**Memory Used**|The memory used by the JVM when the active request started. (if one is active for the thread)|
|**Memory Free**|The memory free in the JVM when the active request started. (if one is active for the thread)|
|**Thread ID**|The unique thread ID.|
|**Thread Name**|The nice thread name.|
|**Priority**|The priority of the thread, between 10 (MAX_PRIORITY) and 1 (MIN_PRIORITY).|
|**HashCode**|The hash code for this thread.|
|**State**|The state of the thread.|
|**Daemon**|Whether this thread is a daemon thread or not.|
|**Blocked Time**|The amount of time that this thread has been in state BLOCKED since the JVM started.|
|**Blocked Count**|The number of times that this thread entered state BLOCKED since the JVM started.|
|**Waited Time**|The amount of time that this thread has been in state WAITING / TIME_WAITING since the JVM started.|
|**Waited Count**|The number of times that this thread entered state WAITING / TIME_WAITING since the JVM started.|
|**CPU Time**|The total CPU time for this thread since the JVM started.|
|**User Time**|The total user CPU time for this thread since the JVM started.|
|**Allocated Memory**|The total number of bytes that have been allocated by this thread since the JVM started.  (Available for Java 1.7 and above)|
