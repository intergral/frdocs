# Slow Requests

**Requests** &gt; **Slow Request** will show a list of all **Slow
Running** and **Slow Finished** transactions, which have taken longer to
run than the current **Slow Request Threshold**.

!!! note
Be aware that FusionReactor has a default **Slow Request Threshold** set to 8 seconds. Change the threshold to either a lesser or a higher value by going to: <br> [Request Settings](Settings.md) &gt; **WebRequest History** &gt; **Slow Request Threshold**  


The example image below lists any transactions that have gone over the slowest threshold. It also lists any running transactions that haven't increased passed the threshold and are still running.

    Slow Requests is the same as [Transaction->Slow Transactions](../Transactions/Slow-Transactions.md) but filtered to only show transactions of WebRequest type.
