# Request Error History

The **Request Error History** page is almost identical to the [History](Request-History.md) page, except that it **only** shows transactions flagged by FusionReactor as being **in error.**

What constitutes an error is - by default - HTTP return codes 500-599.

This setting can be changed in **FusionReactor &gt; Settings &gt; Error Settings**, and is described in [Settings](../Settings/Main-Menu.md).

!!! note
    The **Request Error History** is the same as [Transaction->Error History](../Transactions/Error-History.md) but filtered to only show transactions of WebRequest type.
