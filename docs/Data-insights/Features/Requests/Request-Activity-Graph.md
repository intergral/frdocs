# Request Activity Graph

The **Requests &gt; Activity Graph** is a graph that shows all of the
web request activity currently stored by FusionReactor. In the top right
of the page next to the 'Set Home Page' you can switch graphs quickly by
clicking the 'Time' button to be switched to the WebRequest Time Graph.

Below is a sample image of the JDBC Activity Graph.

!!! note
    The Request Activity Graph is the same as [Transaction->Activity(../Transactions/Activity-Graph.md) but filtered    
    to only show transactions of WebRequest type.

 * See [Transaction->Activity Graph](../Transactions/Activity-Graph.md)
