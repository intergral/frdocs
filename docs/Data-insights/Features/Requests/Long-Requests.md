# Longest Requests : WebRequest

**Requests &gt; Longest Requests** will show a list of the all web
request in a sequential order that have taken the highest amount of time
to complete on this instance.

!!! note
    FusionReactor only keeps a fixed default amount of transactions in memory. If the longest transactions list size gets too
    long or you restart you application server then any old transactions will be removed. 

!!! tip 
    Change the size of the longest web transactions via:  <br>
    **[Request Settings](Settings.md) &gt; WebRequest History &gt; Slow Request History Size **

The example image below lists the web requests by the longest time taken
to complete.

    The **Longest Requests: WebRequest** is the same as [Transaction->Long Transactions](../Transactions/Longest-Transactions.md) but filtered    
    to only show transactions of WebRequest type.
