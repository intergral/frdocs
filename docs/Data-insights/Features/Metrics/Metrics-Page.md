# Overview

The **Metrics** page is similar to the **Web Metrics** page, with one key difference: you can filter the Request graphs to display a single transaction flavor.

This is particularly useful when monitoring a specific group of requests in combination with the [FusionReactor API (FRAPI)](/Data-insights/Extras/FRAPI/).

This page includes the following sections:

| Name                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Graphs**                   | Displays 4 graphs: **Request Activity**, **Request Time**, **Memory**, and **CPU**. Click any graph title to open an enlarged version on a new page. The number and timing of web request errors are also tracked here.                                           |
| **Overview**                 | Shows general statistics about the server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Counts**                   | Provides an overview of the currently monitored request type. **Note:** The **In History** value represents how many of this type are currently stored in the history, not the total that have run.                                                               |
| **Recent**                   | Displays statistics for actions on this server in the last 60 seconds for the monitored request type. The **Recent Slow Pages** link shows all requests from the current request history that exceeded the slow page threshold (defined in **Request Settings**). |
| **Protection (Page Aborts)** | Shows the number of pages aborted due to each of the three types of Protection. Clicking a Protection type displays all requests from the current request history aborted for that reason.                                                                        |
| **Return Code**              | Lists all HTTP return codes returned by this server. Each return code is clickable and shows all requests from the current request history with that code.                                                                                                        |
