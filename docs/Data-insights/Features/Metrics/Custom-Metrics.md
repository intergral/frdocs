# Custom Metrics


On this page, you can view **Custom Metrics**. These metrics are typically submitted using the [FRAPI](/Data-insights/Extras/FRAPI/) method.

```java
FRAPI.getInstance().postMetric("metricName", 12.5);
```

There are many overloaded methods on FRAPI that can be used to post
metrics.

    [FRAPI JavaDoc](https://docs.fusionreactor.io/FRAPI/javadoc/overview-summary.html)

!!! info
    If a non-numeric metric is submitted to FRAPI, it will be displayed as a **column chart** instead of a line graph.



## Changing Graph

You can change the displayed graph using the selector in the top-right corner of the page. The selector lists all currently available graphs.

!!! tip
    If a graph is not listed, try refreshing the page. The selector updates only on page refresh.

## Aggregates

The metrics engine can generate **aggregates** for collected metrics. By default, aggregates are calculated every **five seconds**, **one minute**, and **one hour**. Depending on the FRAPI method used, these aggregates can be enabled or disabled.

Buttons in the bottom-right corner of each graph allow you to toggle the available aggregates for that graph.



```java
FRAPI frapi = FRAPI.getInstance();
Â 
for(int i=0; i<10; i++)
{
    frapi.postNumericAggregateMetric("MetricName",i);
}
```

Values submitted to the metrics engine through FRAPI calls do not trigger an automated sampler. As a result, the graph only displays the data points provided by the user, creating a Live graph that ends at the most recent point submitted. The graph will update immediately when the next point is added.
