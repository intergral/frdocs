**Archived Metrics**.

FusionReactor captures the instrumentation metrics to process into a
number of defined log files.Â Â  The log **Archive Viewer** is used to
visualize the log archives which are generated by FusionReactor. 

FusionReactor captures instrumentation metrics and processes them into a number of defined log files. The **Archive Viewer** allows you to visualize these log archives directly within the UI.

## User interface

### Time frame

The **date and time picker** controls allow you to navigate through log archives and visualize file contents for specific points in time.

!!! info
    When accessed through the menu, the default selection is set to **today**, and the most recent archive file will be displayed.

#### Date picker

* Use the **left/right buttons** to move backward or forward by one day.
* Click the **date input** to open the calendar view (shown above).

#### Time picker

The time picker displays the available rotations for the selected date. Two values are shown:

* **First value:** The time of the first log entry in that rotation.

* **Second value:** The time of the last log entry in that rotation.

* Use the **left/right buttons** to move through rotations.

* Click the **time input** to view all stored log files for the selected day.

!!! note
    The **Archive Viewer** determines the display date based on the logâ€™s **start time**, while the **Log Archive** page uses the **rotation date**.




### Log Files

![](/attachments/245554423/245554448.png)

The **file picker** allows you to navigate between different log files in the archive. Log files are grouped into logical categories, such as:

* **Resources**
* **Request**
* **Memory**

A **search box** is available at the top of the file section. When you search for a log file, the corresponding category will automatically expand (if the file exists for the selected rotation).

!!! info
    Only log files that exist for the chosen time frame will appear in the file section.



### Platform-specific categories

Some log files are platform-specific and not generated directly by FusionReactor. These are grouped under either:

* **Other**
* **ColdFusion** (if FusionReactor is running on ColdFusion)



## Dashboard

![](/attachments/245554423/245554433.png)

When you select a log file (e.g., **resource.log** as shown above), the metrics it contains are displayed in a **Dashboard** view by default.

* The number of graphs shown depends on the number of metrics stored in that log file.
* You can select and compare individual metrics within a single view to gain deeper insights.

!!! tip
    To compare graphs, check the boxes beside the graphs you want to review, then click **Compare Selected**.

The dashboard can be reset to its original view at any time by clicking **Reset Selected**.



### Spreadsheet View

![](/attachments/245554423/245554443.png)


The **Spreadsheet View** allows you to explore a log file with features similar to those found in a standard spreadsheet application.

Key features include:

| Feature                  | Description                                                                                  |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Column sorting**             | Click a column header to sort by that column.                                                |
| **Multi-column sorting**      | Hold Shift and click multiple headers to sort by more than one column.                       |
| **Copy to clipboard**         | Press Ctrl + C on selected cells to copy their values along with column titles.              |
| **Cell selection**            | Select a single cell with a click, or click and drag to select multiple cells.               |
| **Keyboard navigation**       | Use arrow keys to move between cells. Hold Shift while navigating to extend the selection.   |
| **Hide columns**              | Use the hamburger menu in the top-right corner of the spreadsheet to hide or show columns.   |
| **Search bar**                | Filter rows by entering text in the search bar at the top of the page.                        |


!!! info
    The search will match any value within a row. For example, searching for **500** will also match a cell containing **15004**.



### Text view

![](/attachments/245554423/245554458.png)


The **Text view** displays log file data in plain text format.

!!! note
    Any log files that FusionReactor does not recognize will automatically be shown in plain text by default.



### Top controls

| **Control**          | **View**           | **Description**                                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Today**            | All                | Jumps to the current date and displays the most recent data for that day.     |
| **Compare Selected** | Graph              | Displays only the charts selected via checkboxes for side-by-side comparison. |
| **Reset Selected**   | Graph              | Restores the dashboard to its default view.                                   |
| **Sync Tooltips**    | Graph              | Synchronizes tooltips across all graphs when hovering.                        |
| **View**             | All                | Opens a drop-down menu to switch between available views.                     |
| **Export**           | All                | Downloads data in different formats, depending on the current view.           |
| **Set Home Page**    | All                | Sets the current page as your default FusionReactor home page.                |
| **Search**           | Text / Spreadsheet | Filters data in the current view based on entered search terms.               |




#### Sync tooltips

The **Sync Tooltips** feature allows you to pinpoint an event or metric spike at a specific moment in time and then correlate that point across all visible metric graphs.

![](/attachments/245554423/245554453.jpg)

Selected graphs retain context: using the date and time pickers while comparing graphs will **not** reset the view back to the dashboard. This makes trend analysis and cross-graph comparisons much more seamless.


## Data handling & truncation

This section explains how the **Archive Viewer** handles and truncates data for performance and usability.

### Data grouping

Data grouping replaces a sequence of data points in a series with a single representative point.

* Grouped values are calculated using an **average approximation**.
* This typically occurs for larger time periods to improve performance, prevent browser slowdowns, and make trends easier to identify in a chart.

![Grouped CPU graph picture](/attachments/245554463/245554469.png)

### Data Truncation

For performance reasons, data may be truncated in three ways:

1. The **line render limit** is reached ([see Archive Viewer configuration](#archive-viewer-configuration)).
2. The **column in spreadsheet view** reaches a fixed limit.
3. The browser's container reaches a set height and stops rendering.

The **default line render limit is 20,000 lines**. We recommend not changing this, as increasing it may lead to browser slowdowns or crashes, and could risk JVM memory exhaustion.

If necessary, you can adjust this value under:
**Logging â†’ Settings â†’ Log Archive Settings â†’ Line Render Limit**

Other truncation methods are **not affected** by this setting.



## Archive Viewer Configuration

As of FusionReactor 7.2.0, the **Archive Viewer** offers one configurable setting. You can access it via:
**Logging â†’ Settings â†’ Archive Viewer Settings**

![](/attachments/245554474/245554479.png)

### Line Render Limit

The **Line Render Limit** controls the number of lines FusionReactor reads, parses, and renders.

* Increasing this limit allows you to view more data from the log file.
* However, higher limits consume more system memory and can affect server performance.

**Default:** 20,000 lines â€“ sufficient for most daily resource log files.
**Optional:** For complex log files, increasing the limit may be beneficial, but should be done with caution.
