# Kafka Metrics

FusionReactor tracks many metrics for kafka consumers. Each consumer has its own metrics that can be selected in the top right
of the page.

These include (but are not limited to) the following:

-   Assigned partitions
-   Commit rate
-   Heartbeat rate
-   Commit latency average
-   Bytes consumed rate
-   Record consumed rate
-   Fetch size average
-   Request size average
-   Outgoing and incoming byte rate

## Kafka Node Metrics

The Kafka Node Metrics page shows metrics for the individual brokers.Â Each consumer has its own tracking for the brokers it is connected too.
