# Kafka Metrics

FusionReactor tracks a variety of metrics for **Kafka consumers**. Each consumer has its own set of metrics, which can be selected using the menu in the top-right corner of the page.

Tracked metrics include (but are not limited to):

* **Assigned Partitions** – Number of partitions assigned to the consumer.
* **Commit Rate** – Frequency of offset commits.
* **Heartbeat Rate** – Frequency of heartbeat messages sent to the broker.
* **Commit Latency Average** – Average time taken to commit offsets.
* **Bytes Consumed Rate** – Rate of bytes consumed from Kafka.
* **Record Consumed Rate** – Number of records consumed per unit time.
* **Fetch Size Average** – Average size of fetch requests.
* **Request Size Average** – Average size of requests sent to the broker.
* **Outgoing and Incoming Byte Rate** – Network throughput to and from the Kafka broker.

## Kafka Node Metrics


The **Kafka Node Metrics** page displays metrics for individual brokers. Each consumer tracks the brokers it is connected to separately, allowing detailed monitoring of broker-specific activity.
