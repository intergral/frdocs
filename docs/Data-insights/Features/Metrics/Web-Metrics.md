# Web Metrics

The **Web Metrics** page presents data recorded by FusionReactor related to your application server and its request load, organized into easy-to-analyze graphs and tables.

## Graphs

By default, this page displays six graphs:

| Graph                   | Description                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **WebRequest Activity** | Shows the number of completed and active requests at a given time. Errors are also tracked.                                          |
| **WebRequest Time**     | Displays the average time of all completed and active requests. Also tracks the runtime of requests that ended in error.             |
| **JDBC Activity**       | Shows the number of completed and active JDBC requests at a given time. Errors are also tracked.                                     |
| **JDBC Time**           | Displays the average time of all completed and active JDBC requests. Also tracks the runtime of JDBC statements that ended in error. |
| **Memory (MB)**         | Reports memory usage of your server, showing **Max Memory**, **Allocated Memory**, and **Used Memory**.                              |
| **CPU (%)**             | Tracks CPU load for both your **server** and your **application server instance**.                                                   |

### Customizing graphs

The Web Metrics graphs can be customized in several ways to better fit your monitoring needs.

![](/attachments/245549190/245549208.png)

- **Change time range**: Use the time controls at the bottom-right of each graph to adjust the range of data displayed.
    

- **Open graph settings**: Click the ![](/attachments/245549289/245549295.png) icon next to a graph to open a customization modal (pop-up form).

This modal allows you to change titles, colors, and data series for the selected graph.

### Title

| Field                    | Description                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Graph Name**           | The title of the graph, shown under the graph on the Web Metrics page. |

### Series X

| Field             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Select Series** | Choose which data series to display. If the series has not yet been detected, an ID path will appear instead of a friendly title (e.g., `/transit/txntracker/JDBCRequest/history/activity` instead of *JDBCRequest – Activity (Requests/sec)*). |
| **Fill Color**    | Sets the fill color of the series in the graph.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Line Color**    | Sets the line color of the series in the graph.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |



### Add series

Click **Add Series** at the bottom of the modal to add another data series. This duplicates the last series in the list, which you can then adjust.

!!! tip
    There is no limit to how many series can be added to a graph.

!!! info
    Adding many series may reduce page performance.

### Remove series

Click **Remove Series** on the series you want to delete.

!!! note
    The first series cannot be removed.


### Enlarging graphs

Click a graph’s title (below the graph) to open an enlarged view of that graph on a separate page.

## Garbage collection

Garbage collection in Java is not always instantaneous, as it depends on how the Java Garbage Collector operates.

![](/attachments/245549190/245549220.png)

A **Garbage Collection** button is available at the bottom-right of the graphs on this page. Clicking this button will trigger a manual garbage collection and display a toast notification showing how much memory was reclaimed.

Garbage collection works by freeing memory previously occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the program. This helps increase the amount of available memory and improve overall resource efficiency.
