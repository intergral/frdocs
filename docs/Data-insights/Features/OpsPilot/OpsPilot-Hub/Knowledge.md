The Knowledge section in OpsPilot allows you to add general information that helps the system understand your entire technology stack and organization. This feature enhances OpsPilot's ability to provide relevant and contextualized responses.

When adding content to OpsPilot Knowledge, it's crucial to understand that the system relies heavily on titles and descriptions to locate relevant information when answering questions. To maximize the effectiveness of your knowledge base, ensure that your titles and descriptions are comprehensive and accurately reflect all the topics covered in each snippet or document. 

!!! tip
    Always review auto-generated titles and descriptions. If they're incomplete or inaccurate, edit them manually. Precise, detailed titles and descriptions greatly improve OpsPilot's ability to find and use the right information, leading to better, more relevant responses.

Currently, three types of knowledge can be added to OpsPilot:

1. [Snippet](/frdocs/Data-insights/Features/OpsPilot/OpsPilot-Hub/Knowledge/#snippets)

2. [File](/frdocs/Data-insights/Features/OpsPilot/OpsPilot-Hub/Knowledge/#files)


3. [Website](/frdocs/Data-insights/Features/OpsPilot/OpsPilot-Hub/Knowledge/#websites)

### Snippets
- Text-based information with a 5,000 character limit.
- Title field is optional (auto-generated based on content if not provided).

!!! tip
    We advise splitting detailed information into multiple snippets.

!!! Example
    Instructions for configuring logging, README files, Customer support questions, QA, company names and roles.

## Knowledge organization & retrieval

### Filtering

Filter knowledge sources by:

- Search terms

- Types (files/snippets)

- Tags

### Tags

Tags are required for filtering and categorizing data in OpsPilot. Custom tags cannot contain ":" characters, as these are reserved for system tags. System tags are automatically generated by OpsPilot and represent system entities.

Tags:

- Help organize and structure information logically.
- Act as labels to categorize knowledge and improve searchability.
- Provide additional context without altering content.
- Can be assigned to specific services where applicable.
