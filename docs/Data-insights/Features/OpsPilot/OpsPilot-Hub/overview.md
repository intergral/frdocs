OpsPilot Hub is your central repository for storing, managing, and integrating critical operational information. It serves as both the knowledge base for the OpsPilot AI Assistant and your integration control center. Through the Hub, you can connect OpsPilot to essential tools like Jira for seamless ticket management and tracking. 

The Hub's knowledge base empowers OpsPilot to provide accurate, context-aware solutions to operational issues by combining your organization's information with integrated service data. By centralizing your operational knowledge and tool connections in one place, OpsPilot can quickly access relevant data and perform actions across your toolchain, enhancing its ability to assist team members in performing their roles effectively and efficiently.
