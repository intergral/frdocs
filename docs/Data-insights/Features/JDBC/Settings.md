# JDBC Settings

**JDBC &gt; Settings** allows you to modify various elements and
behaviours relating to JDBC. The page is broken up into sections, each
containing a table explaining the options that can be chosen in dropdown boxes or input into text fields.

## Logging / Metrics

### JDBC Logging (Log Files)
|Configuration|Description|Default|
|--- |--- |---|
|JDBC Logging|If JDBC Logging is enabled then each JDBC request and its information will be written to the JDBC log.|Disabled|
|Only Log Queries Slower Than (ms)| Only queries that run longer than this time will be written to the log files. (Optional)|N/A|
|View Size (KB)|This value indicates how much of the log file should be displayed when you view the JDBC log from inside FusionReactor.|128KB|
|File Size|	If the Logging Engine is set to **Centralized Archive and Rotation** then this field does not appear. However, if the Logging Engine is set to **Traditional Per-Log Rotation** then this value dictates then maximum size of the log before it is rotated.|	10240KB|
|File Count|	As above, this value dictates the number of files held in the log history. An incoming log causes the oldest log to be deleted.|	5|

### Query Parameter Text Logging and Limiting

|Configuration|Description|Default|
|--- |--- |---|
|Query Parameter Logging|	If disabled, prepared statements will appear in their unbound form with **?** placeholders. If enabled, FusionReactor will interpret and display each bound parameter.	|Enabled|
|SQL Parameter Text Limiting (Log and Display)|	Limit the length of individual parameters in an SQL prepared statement to a certain amount of characters.|	Disabled|
|Number Of Characters|	The number of characters used for SQL Text Limiting. SQL Statements will be limited to this amount when they are logged.	|10 Characters|

### Statement Text Limiting (Overall)

|Configuration|Description|Default|
|--- |--- |---|
|SQL Text Limiting|	If enabled, the text of the statement will be limited to the Number of Characters field below.	|Enabled|
|Number of Characters|	The number of characters to limit the SQL statement to.	|1000 Characters|


## Stack trace settings

|Configuration|Description|Default|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Query Location|When this feature is enabled and a JDBC request is executed, FusionReactor will store a Java Stack Trace which can be used to find out the location of each query that ran. You change the amount of information which gets stored in this stack trace by going to the Stack Trace Filter page. The resulting stack traces are visible from the Request Details Page page and within the JDBC Log Files.|Enabled|
|Only Record Location On Queries Slower Than (ms)|Only record the location (Stack trace) on queries that run longer than the set time. Recording the location on a query is very fast. However, on systems that run many queries where performance is absolutely critical, you can lower the overhead by only recording the code location of the query for JDBC requests that take longer than a configurable amount of time in ms. (Optional)|100ms|

### Stack Trace Filter

**JDBC &gt; Stack Trace Filter** lets you set up various filters which
are used to make the Java Stack Trace more manageable and readable.

|||
|--- |--- |
|JDBC Transaction with the **Trace** tab activated and visible.|JDBC Transaction with the following filter active **.java**.<br>Therefore, it shows only and all .java file(s) in the stack trace.|
|![](/attachments/245551289/245551327.png)|![](/attachments/245551289/245551334.png)|


#### New JDBC Java Stack Trace Filter

The complete Java stack trace contains far more information than you're
ever likely to need, so this page has been added to let you tailor it to
your own preferences.

To add a new filter, just type a
string into the field provided and click the **Add Filter
Pattern** button. Any lines in
the stack trace which contain that string will be stored along with the
JDBC transaction.

#### Managing Existing Filters

By default, FusionReactor has the following filters on installation and
it will show you any Stack Trace rows which contain references to:

-   `.cfm`
-   `.cfc`
-   `.jsp`

Here you can see a list of all existing filter patterns. Each
pattern has two icons next to it:

|Button|Name|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |
|![](/attachments/245548393/245548405.png)|Edit|Clicking this button prefills the Filter Pattern dialogue with the pattern for editing. Click **Save Filter** when you're done. (Whilst editing any filters you will be unable to delete any filters)|
|![](/attachments/245548393/245548420.png)|Delete|Clicking this button deletes the selected filter.|


## Transaction Settings

|Configuration|Description|Default|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Obfuscate SQL Data|When obfuscating the SQL data, any of the values within the SQL Statement will be obfuscated replacing the text with **?**. See [Obfuscate SQL Data](#obfuscate-sql-data) below for more details about this feature.|Disabled|
|Transaction is Closed|Specifies when the system will close a JDBC transaction. Select the option most appropriate to the timing data you wish to acquire. See [Transaction is Closed](#transaction-is-closed) below.|

### Obfuscate SQL Data

In order to access the **JDBC Obfuscation Settings** please navigate to
**FusionReactor** &gt; **JDBC**&gt; **Settings** &gt; **Transactions Settings** &gt;
**Obfuscate SQL Data**. There you should be able to find something similar
to the screenshot below.

![](/attachments/245551366/245551378.jpg)

By default, the **Obfuscate SQL Data** field is set to **Disabled**.
If you decide to set that field to **Enabled** then that option will
allow you to obfuscate **ALL** the **VALUES** that are in any request
statements that FusionReactor polls.

!!! note 
    You have enabled the JDBC.log file on your
    FusionReactor UI and you'll still be able to see the data **without
    obfuscation.** A fix for this issue with be available in future version
    of FusionReactor.

#### Disabled

If Obfuscate SQL Data is disabled, then you will be able to see
something similar to the screenshot below. All the query VALUES are
**visible**.

![](/attachments/245551366/245551393.png)

#### Enabled

If Obfuscate SQL Data is enabled, then you will be able to see something
similar to the screenshot below. All the query VALUES are not visible
and are **replaced with a question mark (?)**.

![](/attachments/245551366/245551400.png)

Keep in mind that the JDBC obfuscation can be **enabled** or
**disabled** at any point and it will be instantly be reflected on all
the stored, current, and any newly created JDBC Requests. Please make
sure to save any changes made by clicking the **Save JDBC Settings**
button.

The JDBC obfuscation setting can **ONLY** be changed by the following
two users:

1.  **Administrator** 
2.  **Manager**

!!! info
    Observers will only be able to see the data depending on the **obfuscated setting**.

### Transaction is closed

Specifies when the system will close a JDBC transaction. Select the option most appropriate to the timing data you wish to acquire.

Choosing when to close a transaction alters the timing data for JDBC statements.

#### When statement execution completes

The transaction closes as soon as the database finishes executing the statement.  The timing of the transaction – start / end / duration – is therefore tied solely to the time it took the engine to execute the statement.
Use this mode if you are happy with your result set handling, and you suspect the database is slowing you down.

#### When the first result set closes

The transaction closes as soon as the first result set deriving from it is closed.  The timing of the transaction is extended to include both the execution time and the time taken to process and close the result set.
Use this mode if you suspect your page is spending too long processing a result set.
Caveat: if your statement doesn't have a result set (it might be a delete statement, for instance), then the JDBC transaction will close:

When the statement is closed, or
When its parent transaction – probably a Web Request – is closed.  In this case, you'll see **Cascade Closed** as the transaction status, indicating the parent was closed while the JDBC transaction was still open.

If your statement produces multiple result sets, all subsequent sets will be counted for aggregates (Row count etc.) but only the first will be used for transaction timing.|When statement execution completes|

## History

|Configuration|Description|Default|
|--- |--- |--- |
|History Size|The number of JDBC requests FusionReactor keeps in memory. This does not effect the size of the JDBC log file.|100|
|Slow Request History Size|This is the number of requests which will be shown on the Longest JDBC Requests page.|100|
|Slow Request Threshold|Once a request has run for longer than specified here, it is considered a slow running request. Any request over 3 seconds is considered slow.|3 Seconds|
|Query Storage Strategy|This will determine how the sub transactions are stored on their parent. See [below](#storage-strategies) |Slowest X|
|Query Limit (**X**)|This is the **X** value used in the storage strategies.|30|

### Storage Strategies

The Storage Strategies are defined as follows:

 * **First X**: Store the first X transactions that come in. Where X is the value of **Sub Transaction Limit**.
 * **Slower Than X**: Store only those transactions that exceed X. Where X is the **Slow Request Threshold**.
 * **Slowest X**: Store the slowest X transactions. Where X is the value of **Sub Transaction Limit**.
 * **Summary Only**: Store only a summary of the transactions. The duration and any aggregates will be stored, but no sub transactions.

## Query Plan Settings

Automatically generate the query execution plan for long running JDBC calls.

|Configuration|Description|Default|
|--- |--- |--- |
|JDBC Explain|When enabled, slow JDBC calls will trigger the query plan generation.|Disabled|
|Query Plan Duration Threshold (secs)|Once a request has run for longer than specified here, it is considered a slow running request and will trigger the Query Plan generation. Any request over 3 seconds is considered slow.|3 Seconds|
