# JDBC Error History

The JDBC Error History page is almost identical to
the [History](JDBC-History.md) page, except that
it **only** shows JDBC transactions flagged by FusionReactor as
being **in error**.  The error is usually detected by FusionReactor
observing an exception being raised during the execution of a JDBC
operation.

!!!note
    The JDBC Error History is the same as [Transaction->Error History](../Transactions/Error-History.md) but filtered to only show transactions of JDBC type.
