# JDBC History

**JDBC &gt;** **JDBC History** shows a list of completed JDBC
transactions.

!!! note 
    FusionReactor only keeps a fixed default amount of transactions in memory. If the history list size gets too long or you restart you application server then any old transactions will be removed.

You can change the size of the JDBC Longest Transactions via: 

-   **[JDBC Settings](Settings.md)** &gt; **History** &gt;
    **History Size**

    The JDBC History is the same as [Transaction->History](../Transactions/History.md) but filtered to only show transactions of JDBC type.
