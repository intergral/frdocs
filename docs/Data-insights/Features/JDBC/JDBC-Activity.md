# JDBC Activity

**JDBC &gt; JDBC Activity** this page gives you the
ability to view and administer running JDBC transactions on your server.

For each JDBC transaction shown you will see the time at which it began,
the IP address of the client which created it, the JDBC Statement which
was actually executed and the amount of time it has been running.
