## Central FusionReactor dashboard

**Find it**: **FusionReactor** > **Dashboards**

The central **Dashboard** contains links to all dashboards and can be used to quickly navigate between all dashboards.

Log dashboards will be added and improved over time, including adding new categories of dashboards, new log views and new filters to gain insight and value from your logs.

### Using dashboards

Navigate to individual dashboards from the new **Dashboard** tab of FusionReactor Cloud. Use the links in the top right to navigate back to the main FusionReactor dashboards.

### Experimental dashboards

Some dashboards have been marked as experimental, this allows us to continually roll out new concepts for dashboards.

These dashboards may contain issues, as we continue to refine and develop them.
