# Garbage Collection

The **Garbage Collection** page shows a unified view of garbage collection
(GC) in the server. 

The page displays three graphs. All the graphs scroll in sequence
or show the same time frame, the number of garbage collectors shown in the first two graphs
depends upon the garbage collector configured in the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM).

!!! note
    The Freed Memory graph only appears in Java versions 1.7 or higher.

## Duration Graph

The first graph is the **Duration Graph** which shows a series per
garbage collector in the JVM.

Each time varying graph shows two independent values overlaid : 

* **PS MarkSweep Time (ms)**: <span style="color:blue;font-weight:700;font-size:20px"> Blue </span>

* **PS Scavenge Time (ms)**: <span style="color:green;font-weight:700;font-size:20px"> Green </span>

To deselect and reselect each independent value, simply
click on their respective names. When a value is deselected (greyed
out) then that value is no longer displayed on the activity graph.

Placing your mouse pointer on a data point within the graph shows a
tool-tip with details about that sample, including:

* Date and time of the request
* PS MarkSweep Time (ms)
* PS Scavenge Time (ms)

When browsing the 1 Hour, 1 Day, and 1 Week activity graphs you can
select time frames by using the slider under the graph.

### Frequency Graph

The second graph shows the number of times each garbage collector is
being called by the JVM.

Each time varying graph shows two independent values overlaid: 

* **PS MarkSweep Activity (GC/sec)**: **: <span style="color:blue;font-weight:700;font-size:20px"> Blue </span>

* **PS Scavenge Activity (GC/Sec)**:  <span style="color:green;font-weight:700;font-size:20px"> Green </span>

To deselect and reselect each independent value, simply
click on their respective names. When a value is deselected (greyed
out) then that value is no longer displayed on the activity graph.

Placing your mouse pointer on a data point within the graph shows a
tool-tip with details about that sample, including:

* Date and time of the request
* PS MarkSweep Activity (GC/sec)
* PS Scavenge Activity (GC/sec)

When browsing the 1 Hour, 1 Day, and 1 Week activity graphs you can select time frames by using the slider under the graph. 

### Freed Graph

The **Freed Memory** graph will only appear in Java versions 1.7 or higher.

It shows how much memory is being
freed by the garbage collection calls over time.

Each time varying graph shows a single independent.

* **Freed Memory (MB)**: <span style="color:orange;font-weight:700;font-size:20px"> Orange </span>

To deselect and reselect each independent value, simply
click on their respective names. When a value is deselected (greyed
out) then that value is no longer displayed on the activity graph.

Placing your mouse pointer on a data point within the graph shows a
tool-tip with details about that sample, including:

* Date and time of the request
* Freed Memory (MB)

When browsing the 1 Hour, 1 Day, and 1 Week activity graphs you can
select time frames by using the slider under the graph.

### Garbage Collection Button

Under the graph, to the right of the select time frames there is a
**Garbage Collection** button. This allows you to attempt a force
garbage collection and is accompanied by a pop-up notification
indicating how much memory was freed in the process.
