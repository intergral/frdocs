# Thread Activity

The **Thread Activity** page shows you a graph of samples currently
stored in memory by FusionReactor.

## Thread Activity Graph

 Several time spans are
available, with differing resolutions. These will be filled as data
points that are collected by FusionReactor.

 Each time varying graph shows
two independent values overlaid: 

**Threads - Running**: <span style="color: rgb(51,153,102);">**Green**</span>  

* This shows the number of threads currently running on the system.

To deselect and reselect each independent value, simply
click on their respective names. When a value is deselected (greyed
out) then that value will no longer be displayed on the activity graph.

Placing your mouse pointer on a
data point within the graph shows a tool-tip with details about that
sample, including:

-   Date and time of the request
-   Threads - Running

When browsing the 1 Hour, 1 Day, and 1 Week activity graphs you are able
to select time frames by using the slider under the graph.
