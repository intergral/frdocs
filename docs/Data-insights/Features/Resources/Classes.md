# Classes

The **Classes** page shows a graph of the memory samples currently stored in memory by FusionReactor.

## Activity Graph

Several time spans are available,
with differing resolutions. These will be filled as data points that are
collected by FusionReactor.

Each time varying graphs shows two
independent values overlaid :

- **<span style="color: rgb(51,102,255);">Classes - Count : Blue</span>**
    -   The Classes graph shows you the number of classes currently
        loaded into the JVM.

You're able to deselect and reselect each independent values by simply clicking on their respective
names, when a value is deselected (greyed out) then that value will no longer be displayed on the activity graph.

Placing your mouse pointer on a data point within the graph will show a tool-tip with details about that
sample, including :

-   Date and time of the request
-   Classes - Count

When browsing the 1 Hour, 1 Day,and 1 Week activity graphs you're able to select time frames by using
the slider under the graph to pinpoint specific days, times and spikes in your JDBC Requests.
