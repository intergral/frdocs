# Reactor Log

The **Reactor Log** (`reactor.log`) is automatically generated in the
`/FusionReactor/instance/[your_instance_name]/log` directory. The logs are a set of **rotating files**, configurable on the [FusionReactor Settings](../../Settings/Main-Menu.md) page, and contain information about FusionReactor as a whole, typically including configuration details and system activity.

The table below explains the meaning of each attribute in the log file:



|Field Name|Number|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Date (Formatted)|1|The date at which this log entry was written.|
|Time (Formatted)|2|The time at which this log entry was written.|
|Log message|4|Contains a message of an event that occurred such as logging that has started.|
