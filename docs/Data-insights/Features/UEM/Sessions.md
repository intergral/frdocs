# Sessions

User SessionsÂ shows two graphs of the following data points :</span>

-   Created Sessions
-   Destroyed Sessions

Below is a sample image of the **User Sessions** page with little data
shown.

## Sessions Graph

Both of these graphs use the standard set of aggregations to show the values over the last hour, day of week.

On this page you'll see two graphs. 

The first graph contains the following series:

* **Created Sessions**: <span style="color:green;font-weight:700;font-size:20px"> Green </span>
    * This value shows how many user sessions have been created
* **Destroyed Session**: <span style="color:orange;font-weight:700;font-size:20px"> Orange </span>
    * This value shows how many user sessions have been destroyed
* **Rejected Sessions**: <span style="color:Yellow;font-weight:700;font-size:20px">Yellow </span>
    * This value shows how many user sessions have been rejected

The second graph only contains a single series:

* **Active Session**: <span style="color:blue;font-weight:700;font-size:20px"> Blue </span>
    * This value shows how many user sessions are currently active

Placing your mouse pointer on a data point within the first graph will
show a tool-tip with details about that sample, including:

* Date and time of the sessions
* Created Sessions
* Destroyed Sessions
* Rejected Sessions

On the second graph will show :

* Date and time of the session
* Active Sessions

When browsing the 1 Hour, 1 Day, and 1 Week activity graphs you are able
to select time frames by using the slider under the graph. To pinpoint
specific days, times and spikes your user experiences.

* 60 seconds at 1 second
* 1 Hours at 5 seconds
* 1 Day at 1 minute
* 1 Week at 1 hour

!!! tip
    On the page in the top right, next to the refresh option, you are able to filter between different tracked applications.

## Total Sessions

The **Total Sessions** table shows the values for all sessions on the
server, these values are tracked for all applications (even if they are
not tracked)

* The current number of active sessions.
* Created sessions within the last 5 seconds, 1 minute, and 1 hour.
* Destroyed sessions within the last 5 seconds, 1 minute, and 1 hour.
* Rejected session within the last 5 seconds, 1 minute, and 1 hour.
* Total sessions created since the server started.

## Tracking Applications


As it's possible to have many applications running on a single
application server FusionReactor will not automatically track each
application into a graph series. This is intended to save memory;
however, it is possible to tell FusionReactor to create a graph series
for any single application or for all applications.

The last section of this page is used to give an overview of all tracked
and untracked applications. The tracked application can be seen in the
**Tracked Applications** table, and are broken down in the same way as the
**Total Sessions** table.

Here, each application can be quickly untracked by clicking the **Untrack**
button. This removes the graph series and stop tracking sessions for
this application.

In the **Untracked Applications** table you can still see the session
values for each application; however, the values for active, create,
destroyed, rejected are 'live' values and only show the sessions affected
in the last second. The total value is still the total sessions created
for that application since the server started.

!!! tip
     clicking the **Track** button, creates a graph series for the application, and moves the entries to the **Tracked Applications** table.

!!! info
    In order to have tracked applications the settings **Enable** and **Track Session Per Application** need to be enabled in the [User Settings](Settings.md).
