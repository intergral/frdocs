## Menu Settings

The FusionReactor Settings page lets you modify the FusionReactor in order to:

* Configure Email sending
* Configure Access to FusionReactor through specific ports and IP addresses
* Configure the log file size
* Secure the FusionReactor API
* Configure Application and Transaction name detection
* Configure FusionReactor to either track or ignore specific URLS
* Configure a proxy for FusionReactor to contact its external servers for licensing and the FusionReactor Cloud
* Configure which error types should be tracked in FusionReactor

!!! note
    These settings are specific to this instance of FusionReactor, but it is possible to copy these settings to a new instance
     by following [Copying FusionReactor Configuration Between Instances](/Configuration/Copying-FusionReactor-Configuration-Between_Instances).

### Email Settings

|Configuration|Description|Default|
|--- |--- |---|
|From Address|This will be the email address from which FusionReactor will send the notification emails from. This address does not have to be a real email address but must follow the format ( Example : FusionReactor@FR.com )|N/A|
|To Address|This is the email address which will receive FusionReactor notifications emails. Multiple recipients can be entered, separated by commas.|N/A|
|Mail Server|You can specify an Internet address ( Example : mail.company.com ) or the IP address of the mail server ( Example : 127.0.0.1 ) <br> <br> This field must be filled correctly for FusionReactor to send mail. A blank field does NOT use your default mail server. NOTE: If your SMTP server does not use port 25 ( Default ), you can specify a port number after the server address / IP address ( Example : mail.company.com:587 )|N/A|
|Mail Server Username|If your SMTP server requires authentication, you can specify a username in this text box.|N/A|
|Mail Server Password|If your SMTP server requires authentication, you can specify a password in this text box.|N/A|
|SSL Authentication|Enable if the SMTP server uses SSL Authentication.|Disabled|
|TLS Authentication|Enable If the SMTP server uses TLS Authentication.|Disabled|
|Host Name|You can specify the DNS hostname of this instance to be used to generate URL links in email messages. If not specified, the canonical hostname will be used.|N/A|

Once you have set up your email settings you can send yourself a test
email. This is recommended to ensure the email settings are correct.

### WebRoot

|Configuration|Description|Default|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Web Root|This will be the prefix for FusionReactor requests. If the web root was set to "/fusionreactor/" and you were accessing the internal web server on a local machine over port 8088 then your final URL would look like this: http://127.0.0.1:8088/fusionreactor/|/fusionreactor/|
|URL Matching|The rule or which FusionReactor will match URI filters. .cfm This will allow FusionReactor to be mapped to a ColdFusion server over IIS or Apache. .jsp This will allow FusionReactor to be mapped to a JSP server over IIS or Apache. <br> <br> **Complete** -  This will match only the WebRoot, this will result in FusionReactor not working over IIS or Apache, for anything other than UEM. <br> <br> **StartsWith** This will match any URI filter used on the FusionReactor WebRoot. <br> <br> **Custom** - You can set your own filter here by typing into the field. This will map FusionReactor to that URI filter through IIS or Apache. If using .cfm/.jsp or similar FusionReactor will ONLY answer requests to that url. Example If using .cfm FusionReactor will only answer to /fusionreactor.cfm/|StartsWith|
