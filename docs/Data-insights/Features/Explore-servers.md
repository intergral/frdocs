### Detailed graphs


Each graph provides **historical trends** for the metrics shown below.

![Screenshot](../../Data-insights/Features/Servers/metrics.png)

You can:

* **Zoom in or out** on a time range to analyze spikes or anomalies.
* **Hover over data points** to see exact metric values.
* **Compare multiple metrics** to find correlations (e.g., CPU spikes vs. increased error count).

Graphs include:

* CPU and Memory trends
* Garbage Collection behavior
* Request and error rates
* Database and trace throughput

This helps with **root-cause analysis** — understanding what led to a performance change or incident.


### Metric graph actions

![Screenshot](../../Data-insights/Features/Servers/graph.png)

The top-right corner of each metric graph contains action icons that may vary depending on the dashboard and metric type:

1. **Edit Threshold** - Configure alert thresholds for this metric to receive notifications when values exceed defined limits (available on select dashboards).

2. **View Logs** - Access related log entries for the time period and service shown in the graph to investigate issues.

3. **Ask OpsPilot** - Send this metric to OpsPilot AI for natural language explanations and analysis of patterns or anomalies.

4. **Expand Graph** - Open the metric in full-screen view for detailed analysis and extended time ranges.

These actions provide quick access to troubleshooting and monitoring capabilities directly from the metric visualization. Note that not all actions are available for every metric or dashboard type.


### Threshold Configuration 

The **Configuration** page allows you to set and manage warning and critical thresholds for key performance metrics across your application. Thresholds help you identify performance degradation early — when a metric exceeds a configured limit, it triggers visual alerts in dashboards and monitoring panels.

You can adjust thresholds individually on certain graphs using the icon in the top right, or view and edit all thresholds in one place via **Quick Nav** → **Configuration**. 

![Screenshot](../../Data-insights/Features/Servers/configuration.png)


#### Setting threshold values

The **Edit Threshold** dialog allows you to configure two levels:

- **Warning** - Set a threshold for early notification of potential issues (e.g., CPU at 50%)
- **Critical** - Set a threshold for urgent alerts requiring immediate attention (e.g., CPU at 80%)

Enter numeric values appropriate for the metric type. Percentage-based metrics use values from 0-100, while other metrics accept values based on their unit of measurement.

Once configured, thresholds appear as visual indicators in metric panels across the application. When a metric value exceeds:

- The **Warning** threshold - displayed with a yellow/orange indicator.
- The **Critical** threshold - displayed with a red indicator.

This visual feedback helps you quickly identify performance issues across your monitored services.

Click **Update Thresholds** to apply your configuration. The new thresholds take effect immediately and will be used for all future metric evaluations.


### Filters & Controls

At the top of the screen, you can:

* **Select Group, Node, Job, Instance** – to view data for specific servers or services. You can select multiple servers to compare metrics across your infrastructure.
* **Set Time Range** – focus on the last hour, day, or a custom range.
* **Add Adhoc Filters** – isolate data for specific endpoints, users, or environments.

These dynamic filters make it easy to **narrow down the view** when diagnosing an issue. **Filters persist across tabs**, so when you switch between different dashboard views, your selected filters remain applied for consistent analysis.


## Traces

The **Traces** tab provides deep insights into the performance of individual requests (spans) as they move through the system. This view is critical for identifying slow transactions, latency issues, and service dependencies.

![Screenshot](../../Data-insights/Features/Servers/traces.png)

Four key graphs display at the top of the view:

1. **50th Percentile Span Duration** - Shows the median response time for requests, indicating typical performance.
2. **95th Percentile Span Duration** - Displays response times for 95% of requests, helping identify slower outliers.
3. **Status (Top spans by status code)** - Breaks down request volume by HTTP status codes (errors vs. successful requests).
4. **Top 20 Span Throughput** - Shows request volume for the most active endpoints or operations.

Use the filter bar to narrow down traces by:

- **Job** - The service or application name (e.g., quote-service-lucee).
- **Span Name** - Specific operation or endpoint.
- **Status** - HTTP status code (All, error, ok, unset).
- **Flavor** - Request type or protocol.
- **Min/Max Duration** - Filter by response time range.
- **Adhoc Filters** - Add custom filters with the + button.

Below the metrics, the trace list shows individual requests with:

- **Trace ID** - Unique identifier for the request (click to view detailed trace timeline).
- **Start time** - When the request began.
- **Service** - Which service handled the request.
- **Name** - The HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).
- **Duration** - Total request processing time in milliseconds.


### Trace Details

When you click on a specific Trace ID from the Traces list, you navigate to the **Trace Details** view. This view is the core of distributed tracing, presenting the entire transaction flow as a precise waterfall diagram.

![Screenshot](../../Data-insights/Features/Servers/trace-details.png)

The header displays key information about the selected trace:

- **Service and Method** - The originating service and HTTP method (e.g., load-generator: POST).
- **Total Duration** - End-to-end request time (e.g., 513.22ms).
- **Timestamp** - Exact date and time the request started.
- **Status Code** - HTTP response code with visual badge (e.g., 200, POST).
- **Endpoint Path** - The API endpoint or route accessed.

#### Navigation Tabs

The trace details interface includes multiple tabs:

- **Detail** - The default view showing the waterfall diagram of the trace spans.
- **Profile** - When available, this tab displays a hierarchical flame graph showing method execution times and call stacks. Each entry shows the percentage of total execution time and duration (e.g., "100% - 1.61s") along with the full method path, allowing you to identify performance hotspots at the code level.
    ![Screenshot](../../Data-insights/Features/Servers/profile.png)

- **[Event Snapshot](https://docs.fusionreactor.io/Data-insights/Features/Debugger/Event-Snapshot/)** - This tab appears when a snapshot is associated with the trace, providing deep diagnostics including decompilation, frames, and request/response details captured at the point of the event.
     ![Screenshot](../../Data-insights/Features/Servers/event-snap.png)

#### Trace Actions

Three action buttons in the top-right allow you to:

1. **Analyze Trace** - Send the trace to OpsPilot AI for natural language analysis of performance bottlenecks, errors, and optimization recommendations.

2. **Trace ID** - Copy the unique trace identifier to your clipboard for sharing or external analysis.

3. **Export** - Download the trace data in a portable format for offline analysis or archival.

## Logs

The **Logs** tab allows you to view, filter, and analyze the log messages generated by the specific server instance in real time. This is essential for debugging errors and understanding system events.

![Screenshot](../../Data-insights/Features/Servers/logs.png)

### Log Rate graph

The top graph displays the volume of log entries over time, measured in requests per second (req/s). This visualization helps you:

- Identify spikes in logging activity that may indicate issues.
- Correlate log volume with performance problems or errors.
- Understand normal logging patterns for your services.

#### Filtering logs

Use the filter bar to narrow down log entries:

- **Job** - Filter by service or application name (e.g., quote-service-lucee).
- **Instance** - Select a specific container or server instance (e.g., quote-6c4d97dbcc-4hf7q).
- **Filter Text** - Search for specific keywords, error messages, or patterns within log content.
- **Adhoc Filters** - Add custom filters with the + button to refine results further.

Filters work together to help you quickly locate relevant log entries in high-volume environments.

### Log stream

The **All Logs** section displays individual log entries in chronological order. Each entry shows:

- **Timestamp** - Exact date and time the log was generated (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmm format).
- **Level** - Log severity (e.g., SEVERE, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG).
- **Message** - The complete log message, including stack traces for errors.

### Log details

When you click the arrow next to a log entry, it expands to show three sections:

- **Log Line** - The complete, raw log message exactly as written by the application. This includes the timestamp, severity level (e.g., SEVERE), and the full message text with any error details or stack traces.

- **Fields** - Structured metadata about the log entry, including the application name, service, instance ID, source file, and environment. Each field has icons that let you toggle visibility, view statistics, or add it as a filter.

- **Links** - Quick actions to explore related data:
