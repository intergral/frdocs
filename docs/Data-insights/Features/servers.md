ðŸ”Ž**Find it**: **FusionReactor** > **Servers**

![!Screenshot](../../Data-insights/Features/images/Servers/serverintro.png)

 The **Server** view presents an overview of the servers running a FusionReactor agent inside your infrastructure. From inside this view you can choose an overview of your servers or [more detailed information](/frdocs/Data-insights/Features/servers/#detailed-server-overview) about a subset of them. The **Servers** page is the only part of cloud with live mode.

!!! info 
    There is no offline filter on the servers home page. To debug offline servers go to [Explore](/frdocs/Data-insights/Features/explore/). 
    

## Live mode, immediate and historic data

* The Servers screen defaults to **Live mode** indicated by the orange clock.

![!Screenshot](../../Data-insights/Features/images/Servers/liveclock.png)

* Live mode refers to data that is live streamed from an instance and is streamed in real-time. It is useful for viewing and resolving immediate issues. 

* Immediate is data requested from instance in realtime.

* Historic data is stored traces which are powered by the [time picker](/Cloud/guides/timepicker/) To view historic data, simply toggle the **Live mode** clock. 


![!Screenshot](../../Data-insights/Features/images/Servers/livemode.png)

* Historic data can be filtered according to the default times, for example **last hour** or you can customize your time frame according to your needs.

    Transactions stored in FR Cloud from offline instances can be found in the [Explore](/frdocs/Data-insights/Features/explore/) section under Traces. <br> ![!Screenshot](../../Data-insights/Features/images/Servers/explore.png)

### Threads

ðŸ”Ž**Find it**: **FusionReactor** > **Servers** > **Threads**

![!Screenshot](../../Data-insights/Features/images/Servers/threads.png)

This feature retrieves and collects all live system thread data and their respective metadata. This includes: thread IDs, thread names, thread groups, thread states and critical CPU timing.

Sample information is given at the top left, this data relates to the current sample being processed:

![!Screenshot](../../Data-insights/Features/images/Servers/threads2.png)

Name|Description|
|--- |--- |
|**JVM start time** |The time the Java Virtual Machine was initialized.|
| **Sample time**| The time interval at which data was collected or measured.|
| **Thread count**| The number of threads the sampler is currently watching.|
| **Total CPU time (ms)**| The collective amount, to millisecond precision, of each thread's CPU time.|



#### Threads filtering

ðŸ”Ž**Find it**: **FusionReactor** > **Servers** > **Threads** > **Thread state**

![!Screenshot](../../Data-insights/Features/images/Servers/threadsfilter.png)

Threads can be filtered by:

* Any (default)

* RUNNING

* RUNNABLE

* DEADLOCKED

* WAITING

* TIMED_WAITING

* BLOCKED


#### CPU SAMPLER

ðŸ”Ž**Find it**: **FusionReactor** > **Servers** > **Threads** > **CPU sampler**

![!Screenshot](../../Data-insights/Features/images/Servers/cpu.png)

The **CPU sampler** retrieves all active threads and their CPU information since the Java Virtual Machine started. Alongside this, it also render the live state the thread is in. This data will be updated at every page refresh.

The **Delta** feature in the CPU Sampler is an incredibly useful feature. Once delta values are tracked, they provide the user with the current CPU usage since the button was clicked till the current time. 

The **Reset** button (to the right of Delta) allows you to set a new time (baseline) from where the thread CPU time is calculated.

To assess the performance of certain CPU-heavy threads the user can sort the table by highest **Thread CPU time** (%). The more expensive threads will then be filtered to the top. The Thread CPU Time % is the percentage of that particular thread's CPU usage against the total CPU time of all running threads. From there, users can take further action to speed up their server using pre-existing FusionReactor tools, such as:

* Get a stack trace of the thread.

* Kill the thread.

* Profile the thread.

* Pause the thread.

##### NEW CPU snapshot

![!Screenshot](../../Data-insights/Features/images/Servers/newcpusnap.png)


Snapshots provide CPU Sampler information at the exact moment of capture. Multiple CPU Snapshots can be taken and stored in FusionReactor.

Snapshots can be taken at any moment during the execution of a sample, this is achieved by the **New CPU snapshot** button.

    [CPU snapshots](/Profiler/CPU-Sampler/#cpu-snapshots)

#### Thread visualizer

ðŸ”Ž**Find it**: **FusionReactor** > **Servers** > **Threads** > **Thread visualizer**

The **Thread Visualizer** page shows all threads within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for this server. Each color represents the state the thread was in when the data was updated. 

![!Screenshot](../../Data-insights/Features/images/Servers/threadvisualiser.png)

The **Thread Visualizer** page is session based. As soon as the browser tab is closed or refreshed the data will be lost and the graph will restart.

#### Searching

![!Screenshot](../../Data-insights/Features/images/Servers/tvsearch.png)

The search bar allows the user to filter the threads shown based on if
the thread name contains the characters in the search. For example, if the user inputted "http" into the search bar, any thread names containing **http** will be shown along with their table elements.

Threads can also be filtered using the dropdown by:

* Any (default)

* RUNNING

* RUNNABLE

* DEADLOCKED

* WAITING

* TIMED_WAITING

* BLOCKED
!!! info
    Clearing the search bar will remove the filter and all threads will be displayed. 

#### Sorting

![!Screenshot](../../Data-insights/Features/images/Servers/threadvlabels.png)

Threads in the **Thread visualizer** page are sorted by five categories both ascending and descending:

Name|Description|
|--- |--- |
|**Thread name**|The name of the thread given as a string.|
|**User time (ms)**|The user-level CPU time for the specified thread.|
|**CPU time (ms)**|The total CPU time for a specified thread.|
|**Wait time (ms)**|Total time a thread has been waiting (including timed) for another thread to perform a particular action.|
|**Blocked time (ms)**|Total time a thread is blocked waiting for a monitor lock.|

### Profiles

ðŸ”Ž**Find it**: **FusionReactor** > **Servers** > **Profiles**

![!Screenshot](../../Data-insights/Features/images/Servers/profile.png)

This section  provides more information about the Code Profiler details of a transaction or thread.  The Profiler is used to discover what part of an application (method) consumes the most amount of CPU and time. Essentially the Code Profiler can be used to isolate performance bottlenecks in your code.

In the screenshot above, you can see if the transaction or thread is running, if it's finished and the time that it finished. You can also view the status code/IP, the application that generated the transaction, the ID/thread, the URL of the transaction or thread and finally, the total amount of time in milliseconds the transaction or thread took to complete.
