# Enterprise Dashboard

With FusionReactor Enterprise Edition, you have the ability to monitor more than one server instances easily with the use of the
**Enterprise Dashboard**. Any FusionReactor Enterprise Edition
installation is able to report the state of the server remotely to any
other FusionReactor Enterprise Edition server.

The **Enterprise Dashboard** lets you track the state of installations on one or more servers from a single window. You immediately see the state of memory, CPU, DB load and average request time, in an easy to read graphical dashboard display.

Using the **Ephemeral Data Service** you also have the ability to proxy the FusionReactor user interface,  allowing you to access the local FusionReactor instance without having an exposed port.

Once you have your machines set up, go to the dashboard. The default view when bringing up the **Enterprise Dashboard** is to show all groups along with any servers which are currently ungrouped.

## Servers & groups

The **Enterprise Dashboard** contains either grouped or ungrouped instances of FusionReactor. These instances can be from any server with FusionReactor installed, providing the instances have an active trial, Enterprise, Developer or Ultimate license.

### Group information

![Enterprise Dashboard group metrics](/frdocs/Data-insights/Features/Enterprise-Dashboard/images/Group-Metrics.jpg)

The group information pane shows you how many servers are within this
group as well as showing statistics for all grouped servers. These
statistics are:

|Name|Description|
|--- |--- |
|**Group Size**|This shows the number of servers within this group.|
|**Request Count**|This shows you how many requests are running on all grouped servers along with the total number of requests which have been run.|
|**Recent Slow Pages**|This shows how many requests within the last 60 seconds have run longer than the Slow Page Threshold value.|
|**Average Request Time**|This is the average request time for all grouped servers for the last 60 seconds, and for the complete history size.|
|**Average DB Time**|This is the average time spent on database operations for all grouped servers.|
|**Average Memory**|This is the average used and total allocated memory for all grouped servers.|

Additionally, you will see two graphs (Average Used Memory and Average
Request Count.) These graphs show the same information displayed in the
statistics section but they are presented visually for ease of use.

### Server information

![Enterprise Dashboard Group Metrics](/frdocs/Data-insights/Features/Enterprise-Dashboard/images/Server-Metrics.jpg)

The server information pane shows you various statistics about your
selected server. Statistics which are listed with blue titles are links.

!!! tip
    Click on one of these titles to be taken to a more detailed page within the instance of FusionReactor running on that server. 

If a server is currently having problems then the appropriate statistic is highlighted to indicate where the problem is. The displayed statistics are:

!!! tip
    Click the arrow to view a more detailed graph with additional functionality (time lines) within the instance of FusionReactor which is running on this server.

## Manage servers

!!! warning "Upon upgrade, only FusionReactor 8.8.0 dashboards can monitor 8.8.0 instances"
    - If the password of the admin user is changed, it will no longer be managed by an instance running an older version of FusionReactor.
    - To increase the changes of a successful connection, ensure that the server you wish to add to the Enterprise Dashboard is online.

    !!! note
        You can add an 8.7.7 instance and below to an 8.8.0 dashboard, but you cannot add an 8.8.0 instance to an 8.7.7 and below dashboard.

### Add a new server

When you access FRAM, navigate to **Manage Server**. 

![](/frdocs/Data-insights/Features/Enterprise-Dashboard/images//245548868.png)

From this screen you can add new servers to the **Enterprise Dashboard** or manage existing servers.

The form to add a new server has the following fields:

|||
|--- |--- |
|**Name**|This is the name which will appear in the Enterprise Dashboard under your server icon.|
|**URL**|This is the location of FusionReactor on the target server. An example URL will look something like this: [http://127.0.0.1:8088/fusionreactor](http://127.0.0.1:8088/fusionreactor)|
|**Password**|This is the password of FusionReactor on the target server.|
|**Script**|If you specify the path to a script on your server then it will be called when the server goes down or comes up. See the script section below for more information or check out Manage Servers|
|**Status**|Choose if this new server is online or offline. An online server collects statistics and displays them in the Enterprise Dashboard. Warnings will alert to any problems. <br>If a machine is offline then no information will be gathered and the icon will be gray. When adding a server which is currently turned off, set it's status to offline.<br> Change its status later by returning to the **Manage Servers** page (clicking the green button) or by clicking the status button (top right hand corner of a server icon) directly within the Enterprise Dashboard.|
|**Groups**|Any groups set up are listed here. Simply select which groups you want this new server to appear within. Add new groups at any time from the **Manage Servers** page.|

Once you click **Add Server** your new server will be listed at the
bottom of the page (Current Servers) along with its current connect
status. 

!!! example
    ![](/frdocs/Data-insights/Features/Enterprise-Dashboard/images/245548885.png)

### Add an external server in the Enterprise Dashboard

This section, will provide a simple example of adding an external
FusionReactor instance in the Enterprise Dashboard. For this example, an
Amazon EC2 instance was used.

Navigate to the **Manage Servers** tab and **add** all the details of
the external server as described in the section above. 

![](/frdocs/Data-insights/Features/Enterprise-Dashboard/images/245548897.png)

From the screenshot above, we see that the Status code of the
FusionReactor instance with name "tomcat8\_External\_Server" is set to
**OK**. That means, that you should be able to access the FusionReactor
instance externally.

The next step is to access the **Enterprise Dashboard**. Here, you should be able to see the new FusionReactor instance as in the screenshot below:

![](/frdocs/Data-insights/Features/Enterprise-Dashboard/images/245548891.jpg)

Now, you are able to monitor the external server with FusionReactor.

### Managing existing servers

Below the **Add Server** form you will see a list of all servers currently
available in the Enterprise Dashboard.

![](/frdocs/Data-insights/Features/Enterprise-Dashboard/images/245548879.png)

Each server has three buttons next to it:

|||
|--- |--- |
|**Delete**|Clicking on this button will remove the server from this Enterprise Dashboard.|
|**Edit**|Clicking on this icon will take you to the Modify Server page. From this page you can change any of the information which is listed above.|
|**Test**|Clicking on this icon will check the connect status for a server. The screen will be refreshed and you will see a message telling you if there were any problems trying to access FusionReactor on this server.|

Clicking on the **URL** for any server in the Existing Servers list will
take you directly to the instance of FusionReactor which is running on
that server.

### Shutdown / Startup script

The script file which you can associate with a server will get called
whenever that server goes down or comes back up again. It takes 5
parameters, they are:

|||
|--- |--- |
|**Status**|This parameter will have the value **DOWN** or **UP** which correlates to the status of the server.|
|**InstanceName**|This is the instance name of the server in question (as defined on the Manage Servers page.)|
|**InstanceIP**|This is the IP address of the server in question.|
|**PID**|The Process ID of the server. You could use this in order to terminate a server which had stopped responding. (If the PID is unknown then a value of -1 will be passed.)|
|**LastSeen (ms)**|This is the last time (expressed in milliseconds) that the server was last successfully contacted.|


## Manage groups

### Add a group

The process of creating a group is very simple. First, you need to
navigate through the **Manage Groups** page. 

!!! example
    ![](/frdocs/Data-insights/Features/Enterprise-Dashboard/images/245548938.png)

When you access the page, you will see the following fields.

|||
|--- |--- |
|**Name**|This is the name of your new group which will appear in the Enterprise Dashboard and on the Manager Servers screen.|
|**Servers**|If you have any servers currently set up then they will be listed here. Simply select which servers should be added to your new group.|


When the new group has been created, you will be able to see that under
the **Current Server Groups** area. 

![](/frdocs/Data-insights/Features/Enterprise-Dashboard/images/245548953.png)

### Manage existing groups

 Each group has two buttons next to it:

|||
|--- |--- |
|**Edit**|Click this button to change a group name or to change the servers which are currently a part of this group.|
|**Delete**|Clicking on this button will prompt you if you are sure. OK the dialog box to delete the group and refresh the page.|


### View new group in the Enterprise Dashboard

After the creation of the group, you can access the **Enterprise Dashboard**
and see that a new group has been created. 

![](/frdocs/Data-insights/Features/Enterprise-Dashboard/images/245548948.png)


## Ephemeral Data Service

The Ephemeral Data Service provides **Enterprise Dashboard** services to containerized (dockers) or otherwise short-lived FusionReactor instances by allowing them to auto-register with the dashboard, and providing a tunnel to access their user interfaces.

You can use the Ephemeral Data Service to get instant insight into your fleet of containers. It is possible to mix Ephemeral instances and traditionally-configured instances in the same dashboard, and you can group them together or separately.

When an instance registers to the **Enterprise Dashboard**, it establishes an SSL secure channel to FRAM.  This tunnel is used to get metric data and as a proxy for web requests.  This means that FusionReactor instances within your containerized overlay network – which were previously opaque and unavailable to you – can now be accessed directly from the **Enterprise Dashboard**.  All the functionality of FusionReactor's user interface is available.

!!! info "Learn more"
    [Automatically registering FusionReactor instances to the dashboard](/frdocs/Troubleshooting/Configuration/Enterprise-Dashboard-Configuration/).

!!! note
    With the Ephemeral Data Service, if an instance becomes unresponsive or goes offline, it is not possible to receive an alert as the instance unregisters from the dashboard automatically.


## Adding servers to the Enterprise Dashboard

To add instance of FusionReactor to the **Enterprise Dashboard**, you can either manually add the servers or use the [Ephemeral Data Service](#ephemeral-data-service) to automatically register instances when they start.

### Manually adding instances
You can manually add a server in the **Manage Servers** page of the **Enterprise Dashboard**. You can also specify to add servers to the FRAM Enterprise Dashboard if you use Instance Manager to install the instance and specify the **Add to FRAM Enterprise Dashboard** option

### Automatically adding instances

!!! info "Learn more"
    [Automatically registering FusionReactor instances to the dashboard](/frdocs/Troubleshooting/Configuration/Enterprise-Dashboard-Configuration/).

## Restart or connection issue alerts

Instances that were manually added to the **Enterprise Dashboard** will be actively monitored and generate alerts if an instance restarts or becomes unresponsive.

These alerts come in the form of [notifications in FusionReactor](/frdocs/UI/Notifications/) or through an email alert.

![Instance unavailable alert](/frdocs/Data-insights/Features/Enterprise-Dashboard/images/Instance-Unavailable-Email.jpg)

!!! note
    In order to receive email notification you will need to [configure the email settings in FusionReactor](/frdocs/Troubleshooting/Configuration/Email-Configuration/).

## Enterprise scripting

FusionReactor (Enterprise / Ultimate Edition) can trigger a script when a server becomes unresponsive, and when it becomes responsive again.  This mechanism might allow you to pro-actively attempt to restart a failed server or instance, integrate FusionReactor into an existing monitoring environment or provide custom logging or reporting.  Any program which is runnable on your FusionReactor monitoring system may be used an Enterprise Script target.

On Unix and Unix-based systems, this includes everything you can start from a command line, for instance:

    Binary programs
    Shell scripts (including Bash, Ruby, Python and Perl)
    Java programs (when launched from an appropriate shell script)

On Windows systems, anything that is runnable as a binary, or can be run from the command prompt, for instance:

    Binary programs
    Batch files

### How are the scripts run?

FusionReactor runs these scripts by spawning them using Java system commands.  The scripts will be run in the context of the user under commands.  The scripts will be run in the context of the user under which your application server runs.  This user must have at least read + execute access to these scripts.  Any files or other executables called by the script must also be accessible by this user.

The script will be run with the current working directory (CWD) of the application server.  Because of the variety of platforms available, this may be unpredictable.  Any scripts you write should therefore not use the current directory notation (usually a single dot) to address files.  If you plan to access files within the script, their paths should be specified completely.
