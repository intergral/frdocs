# Enterprise Dashboard settings

The Enterprise settings page lets you modify various elements relating
to the **Enterprise Dashboard**. The page has the following items:

## Server Shutdown/Start up alerts

|**Configuration**|**Description**|**Default**|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Send Alert Email|With this option you can specify if you want to be sent an email when a machine being monitored by the Enterprise Dashboard changes state, the different options for this are when the server starts up and shuts down, just shuts down or you can opt to receive no notifications (Disable option). To receive notifications, first configure your email server on the FusionReactor **Settings** page.|On Shutdown or Start Up|
|Generate Notification|Specifies whether you want a FusionReactor notification to be generated whenever an alert email is generated by the Enterprise Dashboard.|Enabled|

## Heartbeat settings for monitored instances

|**Configuration**|**Description**|**Default**|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Heartbeat Metrics Fetch Interval (seconds)|This interval tells FusionReactor how long to wait between each fetch of a monitored instance's metric data (its heartbeat). The heartbeat contains the data that is shown on the Enterprise Dashboard. **NOTE:** Increasing this value will lower the refresh rate of the metric data shown on the Enterprise Dashboard. Decreasing this value may cause heartbeat failures. It is **NOT** recommended to set this value below 5 seconds.|5 seconds|
|Heartbeat Timeout (seconds)|This timeout governs how long FusionReactor will wait for a heartbeat from a monitored server instance. If no heartbeat is received within this time, FusionReactor will count it as a heartbeat failure.|25 seconds|
|Heartbeat Failure Threshold|This setting tells FusionReactor how many times the heartbeat may fail on a monitored server instance before considering it to be DOWN. FusionReactor will then report the server instance as [CONN] (Connection lost) on the Enterprise Dashboard and will run the self-healing script for the instance (if configured). If you are receiving monitoring emails and log messages for instances known to be available, try increasing this value. A value of zero will cause the first missing heartbeat to signal the server instance is DOWN.|3|

## Proxy configuration

|**Configuration**|**Description**|**Default**|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Use Proxy For Enterprise Dashboard|Use this setting to Enable/Disable the use of the proxy server with all the Enterprise Dashboard connections.|Do not use proxy|


## Request count

|**Configuration**|**Description**|**Default**|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Graph Y Scale|This number will be used as the maximum value on the request count graphs within the Enterprise Dashboard. **NOTE:** This value is only used for display purposes. Entering a number here will NOT limit the number of requests a server will accept.|8 Seconds|

## Memory

|**Configuration**|**Description**|**Default**|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Memory Status (percent)|These two numbers (Warn and Critical) are used as threshold values to work out if a server should be put into a warning or critical mode when it is displayed in the Enterprise Dashboard. If the used memory percentage exceeds the **Warn** value then it will appear in **orange**. If it exceeds the **Critical** value then it will appear in **red**.|Warn: 70%
Critical: 90%|

## Average request time

|**Configuration**|**Description**|**Default**|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Average Request Time (ms)|These two numbers (Warn and Critical) are used as threshold values to work out if a server should be put into a warning or critical mode when it is displayed in the Enterprise Dashboard. If the average request time (over the past 60 seconds) exceeds the **Warn** value then it will appear in **orange**. If it exceeds the **Critical** value then it will appear in **red**.|Warn:
4000ms
Critical:
8000ms|
|Graph Y Scale (ms)|This number will be used as the maximum value on the average request time graphs and bars within the Enterprise Dashboard. NOTE: This value is only used for display purposes. Entering a number here will **NOT** limit the amount of time requests can run on a server.|10000ms|


## JDBC

|**Configuration**|**Description**|**Default**|
|--- |--- |--- |
|JDBC Status (ms)|These two numbers (Warn and Critical) are used as threshold values to work out if a server should be put into a warning or critical mode when it is displayed in the Enterprise Dashboard. If the average DB time exceeds the **Warn** value then it will appear in **orange**. If it exceeds the **Critical** value then it will appear in **red**.|Warn:
2000ms
Critical:
4000ms|
|Graph Y Scale (ms)|This number will be used as the maximum value on the average DB time graphs and bars within the Enterprise Dashboard. **NOTE:** This value is only used for display purposes. Entering a number here will **NOT** limit the amount of time database requests can run on a server.|8000|

## Crash protection

|**Configuration**|**Description**|**Default**|
|--- |--- |--- |
|CP Status|These two numbers (Warn and Critical) are used as threshold values to work out if a server should be put into a warning or critical mode when it is displayed in the Enterprise Dashboard. If the number of triggered crash protections (for a given type: request quantity, request timeout or low memory) exceeds the **Warn** value then it will appear in **orange**. If it exceeds the **Critical** value then it will appear in **red**.|Warn: 1 Critical: 2|


## Slow requests

|Configuration|Description|Default|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Slow Page Status|These two numbers (Warn and Critical) are used as threshold values to work out if a server should be put into a warning or critical mode when it is displayed in the Enterprise Dashboard. If the number of requests running longer than the slow page threshold within the last 60 seconds exceeds then the **Warn** value will appear in **orange**. If it exceeds the **Critical** value then it will appear in **red**. |Warn: 5 Critical: 10|

!!! tip
    You can change the slow page threshold from the **Metrics Setting** page.

## Security

|**Configuration**|**Description**|**Default**|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Auto register security|If this is set to **Enabled** then the frregisterwith system property will require the rest username and password to be specified if a server wishes to auto register to the Enterprise Dashboard.|Enabled|
