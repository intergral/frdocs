# Enterprise scripting example

This section will guide you step-by-step through the
configuration process of the Enterprise scripts feature of
FusionReactor.

FusionReactor Enterprise scripting, enhances
FusionReactor's Enterprise monitoring to **trigger** configurable
**scripts** when a server's responsiveness status changes.

!!!note
    The **Enterprise Scripting** feature is only available
    with an **Enterprise**/**Ultimate** license.

## Getting started

In order to start using the Enterprise scripting feature of
FusionReactor, first, you need to locate the **example scripts**
provided by FusionReactor.

The example scripts can be found in the following directory:
**{FusionReactor Installation Directory}/etc/cp**. Inside this directory
you are going to find two folders, **Windows** / **Unix**, and depending on the OS that you are using you can
navigate to inside the folders and choose the script that is best for
your environment.

!! note
    Before you apply any changes in the
    scripts, it's advisable to have a copy of those in another
    directory. The benefit of that is to always have a pristine
    copy available for new scripts.

## Enterprise scripting with ColdFusion 2016 on Windows 

Below is a working example with a ColdFusion 2016 server Windows with the use of FRAM. 

### **Step 1**: Install FusionReactor

In this step we will assume that you have already installed
FusionReactor in your environment and with the use of the automated
installer. If you haven't downloaded FusionReactor yet, please follow
the link in order to get a copy,
<a href="http://www.fusion-reactor.com/download/" class="external-link">Download FusionReactor</a>.

    [Installers](../Installation/Installer/Install.md)

### **Step 2**: Access FRAM via the browser & install FusionReactor instance

#### Access FRAM

When the installation process has been successfully completed, access
FRAM via your browser by typing localhost:8087, where 8087 is the
default port for FRAM. In case you have used another port, then access
FRAM by typing the configures port.

#### Install FusionReactor instance

Navigate to the **Instance Manager** tab and then use the **Scan
System** feature  to search for an application server. 

!!! example 
    A ColdFusion 2016 application server
    is already installed in the following directory: C:\\applicationservers\\coldfusion\\2016.
    Add that directory in the **Root Scan Directory** field press the **Scan System** button.

When the application server, for the above example Coldfusion 2016, is going
to appear, press the add button :fa-plus: ,
and install a FusionReactor instance by following the **Configuration Dialog**. 

If the process has been successful, the following is displayed:

### **Step 3**: Script preparation

 Follow the steps listed below in order to prepare the script that you
are going to use.

1.  **Navigate** to the directory: **{FusionReactor Installation
    Directory}/etc/cp**
2.  **Access** the **windows** folder.
3.  **Locate** the **Restart-Coldfusion9-OnWindows** batch file.
4.  Make a **copy** of that file in another directory.
5.  **Open** the batch file with any text editor.

That script was specifically created for a ColdFusion 9 application
server, however, we are going to make a couple of small changes in order
to use the script with a ColdFusion 2016 application server.

!!! note
    The process and the steps described in that section can
    be used with a ColdFusion 10,11 application server.

-   Firstly, you might want to change the location of the
    output of the script. For this example, I have set the location of
    the log file to be: C:\\FusionReactor\\etc\\cp.  
    ![](/attachments/245549054/245549080.png)
-   Secondly, you might want to change the **username**
    and the **password**. In case FRAM and the ColdFusion 2016
    application server are running under a **Local System account**,
    then **no** changes need to be made. However, in case you are using
    another user, then you need to define the username and the password
    of that user in the script. This action is necessary because the
    script needs to have specific permissions in order to execute any
    commands in the script. In order to identify the user, access
    the **Windows Services**, locate the **FusionReactor AM Service**
    or the **ColdFusion 2016 Application server**, **right click &gt;
    Properties &gt; Log On**.  
    ![](/attachments/245549054/245549098.png)
-   As we previously said, the script has been created for a ColdFusion
    9 application server, so the last change will be in the **Command
    to execute** part of the script. There we need to change the value
    set COMMAND=sc \\\\%HOST% start **ColdFusion 9 Application Server** to
    set COMMAND=sc \\\\%HOST% start **ColdFusion 2016 Application Server**.  

    ![](/attachments/245549054/245549092.png)

**These were the main changes made in the script, please make sure that
you SAVE any changes made before you apply the script.**

### **Step 4**: Adding the script to Manage Servers

The final step, is to add the script to the monitored server's
configuration. To do that, follow the steps described below:

1.  Access the **FRAM** instance via your Browser.

2.  Press the **Globe** icon and navigate to the **Manage Servers**
    tab.  
    ![](/attachments/245549054/245549110.png)

3.  Locate the ColdFusion 2016 application server and press 
    **Edit**.  
    ![](/attachments/245549054/245549104.png)

4.  In the **Script** field add the directory of the script. 

    !!! example
        C:\\FusionReactor\\etc\\cp\\Restart-Coldfusion9-OnWindows.bat  
        ![](/attachments/245549054/245549126.png)

5.  **Save** the new configuration.

## Testing the script

The script can be tested by simply using the Windows Service Control
panel to **STOP** the monitored ColdFusion 2016 service and observing
the script log file,C:\\FusionReactor\\etc\\cp, which shows the output
of the script. If the execution of the script has been successful, then
the ColdFusion 2016 application server will start after a couple of
seconds.

## Conclusion

We've shown you how to configure Enterprise scripting to restart a
ColdFusion server. The scope for what scripts can do is immense, since
there are no restrictions on what they call. It would be a simple
task, for example, to integrate FusionReactor into an SNMP monitoring
solution, write custom log messages or send SMS text messages.
