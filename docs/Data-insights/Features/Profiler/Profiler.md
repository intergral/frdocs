FusionReactor Profiler is on by default for any FusionReactor instances
using an ULTIMATE, Developer or Trial license.  

The profiler is designed to help you identify performance bottlenecks in
your production environment with **VERY** low overhead, so you gain
maximum benefit, without impacting your running applications. The
profiler can be configured to run on demand, so that it will
automatically profile your application as soon as it detects a **long
running request** or **thread**. You can limit the number of profile
samples which are taken, ensuring that impact on your production
environment is minimized. Our tests have shown that even with limited
samples, the insight you gain into performance bottlenecks is
invaluable.

## Slow Requests / Transactions / JDBC

The profiler will sample any transaction which runs **longer than 3
seconds**. Once a transaction is monitored as being over this threshold,
the Production Profiler will start to sample (profile) the transaction
and store the call stack. When that process is going to start, an
**orange clock icon** is going to appear on the top navigation bar of
your screen. This is the Production Profiler icon.

![](/frdocs/attachments/245552294/245552305.png)

When you press the Production Profiler icon, you will be taken in the
**Active Profiling** tab where you can locate all the **slow currently
running transactions**, you can also access the **Active Profiling** tab
by navigating to **Profiler &gt; Active Profiler.**

All the **slow running transaction** that are currently being profiled,
can be found under the **Active Profiling** tab. See screenshot below.

Any **finished slow transactions** that have been profiled can be found
under the **Profile History** tab, under **Profiler &gt; Profile
History**. See screenshot below.

![](/frdocs/attachments/245552294/245552317.png)

The profiler will sample the transaction every N milliseconds, ( 200ms
is the default )the  **Profiler Sample Rate** can be configured in the
**Settings** tab of the Production Profiler.

## Profile Threads

The Profiler supports monitoring any arbitrary thread. This can be
**started** or **stopped** from the **Resource &gt; Threads** page in
FusionReactor by pressing the small clock icon.

![](/frdocs/attachments/245552294/245552311.png)

Once the profiler has been started for a thread the **Profiler**
context will appear below the thread name, similar to the transaction
view. See screenshot below.

![](/frdocs/attachments/245552294/245552329.png)

Additionally, you will be
able to locate the Thread under the **Active Profiling** tab, if it's
currently running. See screenshot below.

![](/frdocs/attachments/245552294/245552323.png)

Or the Thread can be
found under the **Profile History** tab, if the profiler has stopped.
See screenshot below.

![](/frdocs/attachments/245552294/245552340.png)

Profiling a specific thread is limited to 60s by default as leaving the
profiler running for a lot time will generate very large thread
information. This limit can be configured in the
**Profile** **Settings** for the Profiler or can be found in the
Settings of the **FusionReactor Production Profiler plugin**
configuration.

## Profiler Details

This section is going to provide you with more information about the
Code Profiler Details of a transaction or thread.  When
you need to discover what part of an application (method) consumes the
most amount of CPU and Time, you can use the profiler to do that.  
Essentially the Code Profiler can be used to isolate performance
bottlenecks in your code.  

When you access the Profiler tab in the transaction details, you should
be able to see something similar. See screenshot below.

## Details

The first part of the page is going to provide you with general
information about the transaction or thread.

![](/frdocs/attachments/245552387/245552459.png)

For example, you could see if the transaction or thread is running, if
it's finished and the time that it finished. You can also see the status
code/IP, the application that generated the transaction, the ID/thread,
the URL of the transaction or thread and finally, the total amount of
time in milliseconds the transaction or thread took to complete.

## Transaction Details

Most of the Transaction Details remain the same, more information about
transaction details can be found here; [Transaction
Details](../Requests/Request-Details.md). However, in the latest
version of FusionReactor (6.2.0) there are a number of changes made to
the **Profiler** tab.

**The new implementations are the following:**

1.  You have the ability to decompile a class (<span
    style="color: rgb(51,102,255);">Blue</span> color line).
2.  You have the ability to decompile a Method (<span
    style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">Red</span> color line).
3.  <span style="color: rgb(51,153,102);"><span
    style="color: rgb(51,51,51);">You have the ability to add an
    breakpoint into a Method (</span>Green</span> color line).
4.  You can now see the individual times of each call in the Profiler
    window. This is represented as something similar to the following
    **3.0% Self Time**.

!!! info
    Please note that you cannot access, decompile or debug any **native
    methods.**

## Examples

Based on the screenshot below, we are going to demonstrate the new
features of the Production Profiler with simple examples.

![](/frdocs/attachments/245552387/245552454.png)

### Example1: Decompile a class</span>

Based on the following screenshot, we are going to decompile the class:
java.sql.DriverManager

![](/frdocs/attachments/245552387/245552469.png)

By clicking the package identifier a new window is going to appear. See
screenshot.

![](/frdocs/attachments/245552387/245552437.png)

You now have the ability to view the decompiled class.

### Example 2: Decompile a Method</span>

Based on the following screenshot, we are going to decompile the
Method:<span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);"> getConnection  
</span>

![](/frdocs/attachments/245552387/245552464.png)

By clicking the method name, a new window is going to appear. See
screenshot.

![](/frdocs/attachments/245552387/245552431.png)

You now have the ability to view the decompiled Method.

Decompilation is not enabled by default if you are accessing
FusionReactor over the external web server.

!!! info "Learn more"
    See [System properties - decompilation](/frdocs/Monitor-your-data/FR-Agent/Configuration/FusionReactor-System-Properties/?h=system+pro#decompilation) for more information on how to enable decompilation  and more locations to decompile a class.
### Example 3: Add an Entry Point into a Method

Based on the following screenshot, we are going to add an entry point
into the Method: <span style="color: rgb(0,128,0);">DriverManager.java
</span>

![](/frdocs/attachments/245552387/245552401.png)

When you click the Class name, a new window is going to appear. See
screenshot below.

![](/frdocs/attachments/245552387/245552448.png)

You can create a new Breakpoint based upon your needs. More information
about the configuration of the Breakpoints can be found here,
[Breakpoint configuration](../Debugger/Breakpoints.md). When
a new Breakpoint has been created, it can be viewed in FusionReactor
under  **Debug &gt; Breakpoints**. For more information see the
following link, [Production Debugger](../Debugger/Overview.md)

### Example: Lock links

As of FusionReactor 7.5.0, profile stack traces containing locks now
have links to the 'Stack Trace All Threads', and will filter the thread
list to show threads which have either acquired or are waiting on that
particular lock.

![](/frdocs/attachments/245552387/245552416.png)

Upon filtering, a banner is shown at the top of the page to show this.

## More Examples

The examples below are going to provide you with useful information of
how the Profiler works. Theses examples will give you a better
understanding of how the information in the Transaction Details tab can
be used and how the information can be used in order to identify
bottlenecks in a production environment.
