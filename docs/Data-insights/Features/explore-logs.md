## **Getting Started with Logs Drilldown**

1. **Open Logs Drilldown**

    * From the FusionReactor Cloud dashboard, go to: **Explore → Logs**
    * This opens the **Overview page** showing time series and log visualizations for all services in your selected Loki data source.

    > ⚠️ If no services appear, make sure a Loki data source is connected.


2. **Select a data source**

    * At the top left, choose your **Loki data source** (if you have more than one).

    > Note: Logs Drilldown only supports **Loki**.



3. **Set a time range**

    You can adjust the time range in two ways:

    * Use the **time range picker** (top right).
    * Click and drag on a **time series chart** to zoom into a specific time window.

4. **Find a service**

    * Browse services by **log volume**
    * Or use the **Search Services** field to find a service by name
    * To view services by label instead, click **+ Add label**, then choose or search for a label



5. **View logs for a service**

    * Click **Show logs** on any service chart
     → This opens the **Logs tab** for that service, showing raw logs


6. **Explore labels**
