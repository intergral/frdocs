# Time picker

The time picker allows users to select the time period they are interested in within certain areas of FusionReactor Cloud. The time picker can be accessed from any screen where it's supported by either: 

* Clicking its icon in the top navigation bar displays the [context menu](timepicker.md#context-menu).

* Pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd> allows access to the full range of [configuration options](timepicker.md#configuration-options).


## Context menu

The context menu allows refreshing of data for the current time frame, access to some predefined time ranges, control of the [refresh interval](timepicker.md#refresh-interval) and access to the time picker [configuration options](timepicker.md#configuration-options)

### Refresh interval 

The refresh interval controls how often FusionReactor Cloud should poll for new data.

## Configuration options

The time picker configuration options gives access to a more complete set of configuration options including: more predefined quick ranges as well as the ability to manually select both the start and end, time and date. 

From here it is also possible to override the timezone that is used across the application. 

Changing the timezone will adjust all dates and times across the application to the newly selected timezone - but the locale (format) will remain the same. The time picker uses the browser locale for formatting dates and times.
