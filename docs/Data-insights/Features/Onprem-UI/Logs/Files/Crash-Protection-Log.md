## Enterprise Dashboard Scripts

When FusionReactor fires a script, an appropriate message is written to
the [Crash Protection log](Crash-Protection-Log.md), located in 
../<instance_name>/log/<timestamp>/crashproteciton.log.
This log is shared with other CrashProtection messages, and not all
fields are used by Enterprise scripting.

|Field Name|Description|
|--- |--- |
|Date|Formatted date|
|Time|Formatted time, to millisecond precision|
|Time (Epoch)|Absolute time, measured in milliseconds from midnight on January 1st 1970|
|Server State| **ServerUP** or **ServerDOWN** - The triggering state for this script invocation|
|Script State<br>One of:|**RUNSCRIPT** - Script successfully called<br>**SCRIPTREADFAILED** - Script not found, or not readable<br>**SCRIPTEXCEPTION** - Script found and readable, but an exception occurred during run|
|6 Unused Fields||
|Server ID|Server ID of the affected instance, configured within Server Manager|
|Script|Full command and arguments launched by FusionReactor|
|Unused Fields|The remainder of the log string is unused.|

!!!error ""
    For the exceptional cases **SCRIPTREADFAILED** and **SCRIPTEXCEPTION**,
    FusionReactor will log the message associated with the exception to the
    FusionReactor log.
