Monitoring an application is essential for delivering a high-quality product and ensuring a positive user experience. However, merely gathering a multitude of application metrics doesn't address the core issue. What software companies truly require is a mechanism to derive actionable insights from their metrics, enabling them to promptly address any issues their users may encounter.

Enter the RED method.

This new feature enhances observability by enabling users to track the **probability of anomalies** in critical service metrics, known as RED (Request, Errors and Duration rates). RED not only allows for closer monitoring of these key metrics but also provides notifications when they exceed set thresholds, offering a more proactive approach to service management.

!!! tip
    Remember that the Anomaly Detection feature needs to be turned on in your FusionReactor settings. Don't miss out on its ability to proactively identify potential issues!


### Core metrics: The RED framework


<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/920397811?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Enhance Observability with Anomaly Detection in FusionReactor"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

Central to FusionReactor Cloud's new anomaly detection feature are the RED metrics:

| Metric         | Description     | 
|--------------|-----------|
| **Requests**| Measures the rate at which requests are made to your services.|
| **Errors**| Tracks the occurrence and type of errors within your services.|
| **Duration**| Records the time taken for each service request to complete.|

### Functionality of Anomaly Detection

| Function         | Description     | 
|--------------|-----------|
| **Gathering data**| For each service, FusionReactor Cloud conducts three additional Prometheus queries to collect data on RED metrics.|
| **Anomaly analysis**| The time series data from these metrics is examined using an 'iforest' algorithm, which excels in calculating the likelihood of anomalies in the latest RED data.|
| **Data display**| Grafana dashboards are available for users to observe both the RED metrics and their anomaly probabilities.|


### Configurable alert system

!!! note
    The Anomaly Detection feature is not enabled by default. Ensure you explicitly switch it on in the settings to utilize its benefits

## Best practice for Anomaly Detection configuration

### Understanding service-specific metric profiles

Each service you monitor with FR Cloud has its unique profile for Rate, Errors, and Duration metrics. The profile varies based on the duration selected for calculating anomaly probabilities, which can range from an hour to a maximum of one week. For effective anomaly detection, it's essential to tailor the configuration for each service by considering the following:

| Setting        | Description     | 
|--------------|-----------|
| **Time frame selection**| Choose an appropriate time frame that reflects the service's operational patterns for anomaly probability calculations.|
|**Threshold settings**| Set suitable threshold levels for anomaly probabilities to minimize false positives and negatives.|
| **Duration for threshold exceedance**|  Configure the minimum duration that the threshold level must be exceeded for an anomaly to be reported. This helps by filtering out transient spikes that may not be indicative of a systemic issue.|

### Tips for optimizing Anomaly Detection

| Feature        | Description     | 
|--------------|-----------|
| **Historical data analysis**| To determine the optimal **Threshold** and **For** values for anomaly detection, it is often useful to analyze the probabilities of a RED metric over an extended period, such as one week or even thirty days. This historical perspective can help identify the appropriate settings for a shorter period, like one day, ensuring that the detection is sensitive to true anomalies while ignoring normal fluctuations.|

### The importance of tailoring settings

| Feature        | Description     | 
|--------------|-----------|
| **Uniform settings aren't always effective**| Services differ in their operational conditions and behavioral patterns, necessitating individualized adjustments in anomaly detection settings.|
|**Threshold settings**| Set suitable threshold levels for anomaly probabilities to minimize false positives and negatives.|
| **Need for regular review and modification**|  Anomaly detection in FR Cloud is an active process. Regularly reviewing and fine-tuning these settings is vital to align with changes in service behavior and usage patterns.|


Understanding and addressing these aspects will greatly improve the precision and effectiveness of FR Cloud's anomaly detection capabilities.
