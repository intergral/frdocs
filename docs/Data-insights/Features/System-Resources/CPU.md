This page takes the **CPU graph** from the **System Metrics** page and
allows you to perform zoom operations on it to interpret the data
further.

The content of this graph is already covered on the [System
Metrics](System-Metrics.md) page.

#### With Per Core Sampling Setting Enabled

In the ***Settings*** page of **System Resources**, an option exists to
**enable** '**Per Core Sampling**'. If this setting has been enabled,
this page changes a little bit.Â The first visible change, is in the top
right next to the 'Set Home Page' button. It should now look as follows:

The Default page shown above is known as the '**Combined Graph**', and
the two new graph types are 'Single Graph' and 'Graph per Core'. The
links shown in the image will update depending on which graph you are
currently viewing.

#### Single Graph

The '**Single Graph**' shows all cores appended one on top of the other
on a single graph.
