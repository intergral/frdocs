This page takes the Disk graph from the System Metrics page and allows
you to perform zoom operations on it to interpret the data further. In
the top right, two links can be seen (next to the 'Set Home Page'
button). The 2nd link is a drop-down that allows you to choose which
disk you would like to view metrics for. The final link, will be covered
in the next section.

The content of this graph is already covered on the [System
Metrics](System-Metrics.md) page.
