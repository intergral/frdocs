title: JRun Plugin

# FusionReactor JRun Plugin

This plugin allows you to access the JRun log files.

## Configuration

This page allows you to enable or disabled the creation of JRun Event
Log Entries. Enabling this will allow the plugin to log JRun server
events which are then included in the FusionReactor Centralized Log
Rotation when it occurs. The logs can also be used to analyze the
server. The option you choose does not alter the JRun Log Directory
setting.

## Log File - fr.jrun-event.log

This log is called fr.jrun-event.log. **Don't** confuse this with that
status log, the status log displays the state of the plugin (on, off and
error) where as this describes what the plugin is doing (starting
applications etc).
