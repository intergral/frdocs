title: Lucee + Railo Line Perf

# FusionReactor Lucee and Railo Line Performance Plugin

The FusionReactor Lucee and Railo Line Performance Plugin are able to profile the
execution of ColdFusion CFML code at line level. This data can be used
to identify performance issues deep inside your ColdFusion pages and
components and can be an invaluable tool for finding problems within
your applications. This feature also gathers information about the CFML
code coverage which can be very valuable when testing applications.

!!!warning "Performance Impact"
    Please note that this feature uses line number information generated
    by the Lucee or Railo application server that is known to be inaccurate
    in some cases and beyond our control. For this reason we cannot
    guarantee 100% accuracy of the information. Also note that the
    performance of the Lucee or Railo application server may be
    impacted while tracking line performance profile data. You should use
    FusionReactor version 6.2.0 or higher.

Please see below for important considerations about using this feature
on productions systems.

## Getting Started

You must have FusionReactor 6.2.0 or above currently installed on your
Lucee or Railo application server

1.  Go to: **FusionReactor** &gt; **Plugins **&gt; **Active Plugins**  
    ![](/frdocs/attachments/245548033/245548045.png)

2.  On the Active Plugins page depending upon your application server
    search for the relative line performance plugin.  
    ![](/frdocs/attachments/245548033/245548055.png)
3.  On the Configuration page - **Enable Track CFML Line Execution
    Times**  
    ![](/frdocs/attachments/245548033/245548060.png)

4.  Save the updated configuration.

    This will have immediate effect.

    When you enable CFML Line Performance Tracking the currently
    compiled templates have to be recompiled with instrumentation in
    them for collecting line metric information. This results in the
    Lucee or Railo CFMLEngine being reinitialized and the class
    cache emptied until the templates have been recompiled.
    Recompilation can be an expensive task and could result in an
    application stalling. Also note the compilation will take longer
    than normal with CFML Line Performance Tracking because the code
    must be instrumented heavily with metric gathering data.

5.  Depending upon your size of your applications and how many your
    Lucee or Railo application server is currently running you may
    notice a performance hit. This should quickly return to normal once
    the class have been recompiled.

    We recommend that the Lucee line profiler should not always be
    enabled. As each line of code will be tracked heavily impacting your
    server performance. However, please be aware that disabling the
    plugin will cause a reinitialize of the CFML Engine, causing the
    class cache to be cleared and requiring all the other to be
    recompiled.

6.  We have written a simple tool in CFML that allows you to examine the
    performance of your ColdFusion application code on a line by line
    basis. The tool requires that you have FusionReactor installed and
    have enabled Track CFML Line Execution Times in the Lucee or Railo
    Plugin.

    1.  You will need to install this application into your Lucee or
        Railo **webapps/ROOT** and access it via the following browser
        address; 
        1.  <a href="http://localhost:8888/cfperformanceexplorer-master/#content" class="uri external-link">http://localhost:8888/cfperformanceexplorer-master/#content</a>

    ![](/frdocs/attachments/245548033/245548050.png)

    This tool can be
    found [https://github.com/intergral/cfperformanceexplorer](https://github.com/intergral/cfperformanceexplorer) in our GitHub repository.

7.  If you don't wish to use the tool - then you can also get access to
    the data via the **FusionReactor API (FRAPI)**.

With tracking enabled, FusionReactor captures the information about each
line of CFML code executed and stores the data internally. Using the
FusionReactor API you can gain access to this information and use it
generate reports about the performance of your code:

The following code will output the performance information for all of
the files that have been profiled:

 
```cfm
<h1>CFM Line Performance Tracking Tool</h1>
<cfset fragentClass = createObject("java", "com.intergral.fusionreactor.agent.Agent")>
<cfset sourceFiles = fragentClass.getAgentInstrumentation().get("cflpi").getSourceFiles()>
<cfloop from=1 to=#arraylen(sourceFiles)# index="i">
   <cfset sourceLineMetrics = fragentClass.getAgentInstrumentation().get("cflpi").getSourceLineMetrics(sourceFiles[i])>
   <cfoutput>
       <h2>
           Source: #sourceFiles[i]#: Code Coverage: #sourceLineMetrics.getCodeCoverage()*100#%
       </h2>
   </cfoutput>
   <cfoutput>
       <h4>
           Lines covered: #sourceLineMetrics.getCodeCoverageLineCount()# of #sourceLineMetrics.getTotalLineCount()#
      </h4>
   </cfoutput>

   <cfset lineMetricMap = fragentClass.getAgentInstrumentation().get("cflpi").getLineMetrics(sourceFiles[i])>
   <cfset sortedKeys = createObject("java", "java.util.TreeSet").init(lineMetricMap.keySet()).iterator()>
   <cfloop condition="sortedKeys.hasNext()">
      <cfset entry = sortedKeys.next()>
      <cfset lineMetric = lineMetricMap.get(entry)>
      <cfset lineNumber = lineMetric.getLineNumber()>
      <cfset count = lineMetric.getCount()>
      <cfset nanoTime = lineMetric.getNanoTime()>
      <cfoutput>
          <ul style="margin: 0">
          #sourceFiles[i]# #lineNumber#: Count: #count#, Time: #nanoTime#, Average: #nanoTime / (count eq 0 ? 1 : count)#
          </ul>
      </cfoutput>
   </cfloop>
</cfloop>
```

### Considerations for Production Systems

The following points must be considered when enabling and disabling this
feature on production systems:

1.  Enabling or disabling CFML Line Performance Tracking will result in
    the Lucee or Railo CFML Engine
    being reinitialized and the class cache being
    emptied, requiring a complete recompilation of your
    application code which may be very time consuming and will impact
    the performance of your application abruptly and immediately
2.  Under production load, the Lucee or Railo application server may not
    be able to recompile the code fast enough to keep up with user load,
    resulting in requests waiting and your application could stall
    completely. 
3.  CFML Line Performance tracking can be an expensive action as every
    single execution of every line of code by every request/thread is
    tracked. Under production load, when you have a lot of
    requests/threads running (potentially the same code) the performance
    of the application may be too heavily impacted for this feature to
    be enabled. The granularity of the data capture that this feature
    requires may mean that your server does not have enough CPU capacity
    left to meet both the production application's load and the line
    performance tracking requirement at the same time. 
4.  The overall performance of the application can be heavily impacted.
    The performance impact of this feature ranges typically between
    2-10% but can be much higher depending on the code being executed.
5.  Configuring fewer simultaneous requests in Lucee or Railo may
    mitigate these affects in some cases.
