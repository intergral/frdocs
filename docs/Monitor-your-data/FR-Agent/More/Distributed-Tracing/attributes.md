# Span attributes
Attributes are information providing extra insight into the span.

!!! warning "Warning: Data Obfuscation"
    Span attributes are not obfuscated by default, network and database information could be present. Enable obfuscation for datapack and semantic attributes via [system properties](#properties-used-for-attributes) to ensure that no confidential data can be passed.

!!! info "Potential cause of missing attributes"
    An attribute might not have been set on the span if the attribute's value was null or empty.

!!! note "Potential cause of truncated attribute values"
    An attribute value ending in `...` indicates that it has been truncated to limit data size.

## Properties used for attributes
Add to JVM arguments/options by prepending with `-D`.

| Property key | Default | Description |
| -- | -- | -------- |
| `fr.observability.trace.attributes.datapack.enabled` | `true` | If enabled, sets datapack (cloud UI) attributes on spans. WARNING: Transactions/spans will no longer be rendered in the FusionReactor Cloud UI. |
| `fr.observability.trace.attributes.datapack.obfuscation.enabled`  | `false`  | If enabled, attempts to obfuscate datapack span attributes. |
| `fr.observability.trace.attributes.semantics.enabled`             | `true`  | If enabled, sets semantic attributes on spans. |
| `fr.observability.trace.attributes.semantics.obfuscation.enabled` | `false` | If enabled, doesn't set or obfuscates `net.peer.port`, `net.peer.name`, `net.peer.ip`, `db.statement`, query string in `http.url` (for FusionRequest/WebRequests), `http.client_ip`, and `db.cassandra.coordinator.dc` semantic attributes. |
| `fr.observability.trace.attributes.request.headers` | `""` | Comma separated list of request header names to match and attach header to WebRequest, OkHttp and Httpclient span attributes. |
| `fr.observability.trace.attributes.response.headers` | `""` | Comma separated list of response header names to match and attach header to WebRequest, OkHttp and Httpclient span attributes. |
