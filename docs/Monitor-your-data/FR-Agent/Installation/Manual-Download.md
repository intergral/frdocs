The installation of FusionReactor requires a javaagent to run the core FusionReactor product when your application starts.

There is also a Debug library that can be optionally added for use of the **Debugger** and **Event Snapshot** features. 

!!! tip
    We recommend installing this argument if you have a trial, ultimate or developer edition to access the full functionality of FusionReactor.

Download the **fusionreactor.jar** file and **Debug library**, [here](https://www.fusion-reactor.com/download-fusionreactor/).
