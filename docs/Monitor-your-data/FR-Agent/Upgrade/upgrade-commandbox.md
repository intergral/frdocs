# CommandBox

Upgrading  FusionReactor in  CommandBox is a simple procedure.  On each FusionReactor release, a new version of the FusionReactor agent and debug library is published to the
FusionReactor [ForgeBox repository](https://www.forgebox.io/view/FusionReactor). This ensures that your FusionReactor version is kept up to date without you having to do anything.

To upgrade, run:<br>
`server restart`
