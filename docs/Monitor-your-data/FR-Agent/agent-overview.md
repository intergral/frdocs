# Overview

FusionReactor provides you with real-time observability metrics, combined with application, system and database performance data. Using FusionReactor, you can quickly investigate and pinpoint issues and performance bottlenecks.

Our goal is to support developer and DevOps teams by enabling them to identify and understand application issues before these affect your end customers. FusionReactor’s low-level insight approach cuts to the chase and delivers the answers you need in the format you understand: data and code.

The FusionReactor agent can be used to monitor Java and ColdFusion to deliver current and historical information about web transactions, memory & CPU usage, database query performance, code – memory and thread profiling, garbage collection data and automated error detection plus much more.

## Benefits
 
 FusionReactor provides:

* detailed information about your application's performance, including memory and CPU usage, slow request analysis, and more. 

* an alerting system to help you proactively identify and resolve performance issues before they become critical problems. 

Installing FusionReactor helps improve the stability, reliability and performance of your Java applications, making sure they meet the demands of your users.
