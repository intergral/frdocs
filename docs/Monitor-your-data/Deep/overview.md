FusionReactor seamlessly integrates with Deep, a dynamic monitoring tool that enhances existing monitoring capabilities in real-time. Deep, facilitates the collection of application data precisely when it's needed. This user-friendly, and cost-effective solution dynamically instruments applications, to ensure seamless runtime application observability.

At the heart of Deep lies its powerful query language, DeepQL. A monitoring-centric query and command language, that draws inspiration from PromQL, streamlines the real-time addition and manipulation of logs, metrics, traces, and live data snapshots. This empowers users with more effective debugging, heightened system visibility, and improved performance monitoring capabilities.
