## Installing the Observability Agent via Docker

When running in [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#env), you will **not** be prompted for any information. Therefore, you must specify an API key before running. Additionally, you must set the relevant [environment variables](/Cloud/Observability-Agent-Install/Configuration/), for whichever services you have running, so they can be configured.

To run in Docker, we provide prebuilt images in our Docker Hub repository.
