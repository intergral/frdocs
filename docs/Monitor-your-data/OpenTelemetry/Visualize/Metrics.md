# Visualizing your metrics


Metrics provide ongoing visibility into numerical and statistical data about your applications and services. For example, you can track CPU utilization, memory usage, or concurrent user counts in real-time.

To visualize your OTel metrics, simply navigate to the **Explore** tab in FusionReactor Cloud. Alternatively, create your own personalized dashboards to provide a tailored view of your application's OTel metrics.

## Python example 

!!! info
    The following example relies on a user having first [instrumented a Python application](/Monitor-your-data/OpenTelemetry/Instrumentation/Python/) to ship data to FR Cloud. 

In the FR Cloud **Explore** window, ensure the metrics datasource is selected. Then either use the **Builder** to find your metric (you can search for `job`: `fib_by_iteration`), or use the following in **Code** search mode: `fib_iteration_counter_total{job="fib_by_iteration"}`. You'll get a graph and table of the metric.
