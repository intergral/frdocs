# Sending logs via the FusionReactor Agent
FusionReactor will send log files collected by the Agent automatically.

These logs are:

- Exception logs
- ColdFusion logs
    - ColdFusion out log
    - ColdFusion error log
    - Server log
    - application.log
- Commandbox logs
    - server.log
- Tomcat logs
    - catalina.out
- Lucee logs
  - catalina.out
  - WEB-INF logs
    - application.log
    - deploy.log
    - exception.log
- Application logs
    - Stdout
    - Stderror

## Sending FusionReactor metric and transaction logs
Logs generated from the FusionReactor Agent that contain the metrics, traces and support information are not shipped by default.

You can enable sending of these logs in the [logging > cloud settings](/Data-insights/Features/Logs/Cloud-Settings/#log-shipping).

## Scraping additional logs using FusionReactor

You also have the ability to allow FusionReactor to scrape any additional logs stored on the server, providing the user running FusionReactor can access these files.

Log scraping allows you to utilize the FusionReactor Agent to send other logs contained from the same server.

This could include application logs for ColdFusion, Tomcat, Lucee or other application servers as well as other processes such as Nginx, IIS, Database and more.

!!!note
    Sending logs via the FusionReactor Agent is a simple way to send additional logs with limited configuration; however, this isn't a recommended approach to send large quantities of data as it can slow down the application.

!!! tip 
    When scraping additional logs, ensure that multiple FusionReactor instances are not scraping the same files, for example if you have 3 instances on one machine scraping system files or stdout / stderr. While this won't cause errors, it results in duplicate data.

Configure scraped logs within [logging > cloud settings](/Data-insights/Features/Logs/Cloud-Settings/#log-scraping).

### Scrape examples

!!! example
    To send all logs for a Tomcat server in linux:
    ````/opt/servers/tomcat/tc7/logs/*log````

!!! example
    To send just the CF exception and application log on Windows:
    ````C:\\ColdFusion2018\\cfusion\\logs\\exception.log,C:\\ColdFusion2018\\cfusion\\logs\\application.log````

## How to prevent logs from shipping

As mentioned above, logs generated by the FusionReactor Agent are shipped automatically to the cloud provided the log shipper is enabled.

Prevent log files shipping using a regex pattern in the [logging > cloud settings](/Data-insights/Features/Logs/Cloud-Settings/#log-exclusion), using a similar mechanism to log scrape.

## How to obfuscate logs sent via the FusionReactor Agent

It is possible that applications can log sensitive data.

For example if you log passwords in debug logs, these may need to be obfuscated:

![](/Monitor-your-data/Log-monitoring/images/obfuscation.png)

You have the ability to obfuscate and data within log files by adding regex replacement rules under [Logging > Cloud Obfuscation settings](/Data-insights/Features/Logs/Cloud-Log-Obfuscation-Rules/).

## How to rollup multiple log lines into one

Logs generated by FusionReactor could end up having exceptions in them.

Usually they are formatted in such a way that they are sent up as a single multiline block, however some servers do not provide the required formatting resulting in a stack trace exception sent as multiple log lines.

We provide you with the capability to design your own rules for rolling up multiple logs into one before they are sent up in the observability chain. They can be specified on FusionReactor and scraped logs.

You can add rollup rules within [Logging > Cloud Log Multiline Blocks](/Data-insights/Features/Logs/Cloud-Log-MultiLine-Blocks/)
