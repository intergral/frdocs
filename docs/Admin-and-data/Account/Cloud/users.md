#### Organization Profile

The Organization Profile section lets you view and update your organization's name and logo, which are shown to all members across the interface.

#### Leave Organization

The **Leave Organization** option lets any member (except the last admin) remove themselves from the org, which immediately revokes access to all org data and requires a new admin invitation to rejoin.

!!! note
    If you're the last admin in the organization, you **cannot leave** — you must either promote another member to admin or delete the organization instead.



#### Delete Organization

Only admins can delete the organization, which permanently removes all members, data, and settings — this action cannot be undone.


### Members

The **Members** tab in FusionReactor Cloud allows you to manage all users associated with your organization. You can view member details, assign roles, invite new members, and control access.
