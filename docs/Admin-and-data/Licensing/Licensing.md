    ***Are You Using a Proxy?***

    When applying, activating, or deactivating a license, you may be brought to the 'Manual Activation' or 'Manual Deactivation' pages. The reason for this is that your FusionReactor client was unable to communicate with the internet. In 6.2.0, the option to configure a proxy was added. This will allow you to tunnel FusionReactors internet connection through your own proxy. You can find out more information by visiting this link: FusionReactor Proxy Settings
