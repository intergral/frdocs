# How to configure email settings

To use features such as **Reporting**, **Debug** alerts, **Enterprise dashboard** alerts and **Crash protection**, first configure the email settings in FusionReactor.

 The settings in FusionReactor are per instance, so if you have five instances of FusionReactor they each have their own settings.
 
 To copy the configuration of FusionReactor from one instance to another:

> ðŸ“– **Learn more:**
>  [Copying FusionReactor configuration between instances](/Configuration/Copying-FusionReactor-Configuration-Between_Instances). 
 
 With this approach you can configure one instance of FusionReactor then copy the configuration across all five instances.

 public mail servers, simply Google: *SMTP server gmail/gmx/outlook/etc...*.

 **Step 3:** Once your SMTP server details have been entered, save the settings and select **Send Test Email**.

 **Step 4:** Sending a test email, should display the following green banner:

 You will now start to receive [Reporting](../Plugins/FusionReactor-Reports-Plugin.md) and [Enterprise dashboard alerts](../Enterprise-Dashboard/Enterprise-Dashboard.md) and can configure [Crash protection](../Crash-Protection/Crash-Protection.md) and [Email breakpoints](../Debugger/Debug-Email-Alert.md).



## What to do if the test email fails to send

![Email_Failure](../images/configuration/Email-Failure.jpg)

There are many reasons that sending an email from FusionReactor may fail, including:

* The protocol being used is incorrect
* The authentication credentials to the mail server are incorrect
* The mail server configuration is correct
* The mail server blocks emails from the specified from address

!!! warning
    FusionReactor is only able to detect a send failure if its attempt to send a mail to the SMTP server fails. 
    
    
It may be that we are able to send a mail to the SMTP server, but the mail server itself rejects the email. In this case we are unable to detect that the operation failed.

If this is the case we will show **Email sent successfully**, but the email may never arrive in your mailbox. Please contact your mail server administrator.

Any error FusionReactor sees when an attempt to send an email is stored in the [reactor.log](../Logs/Files/Reactor-Log.md). In this log file you will see the cause of the send failure and be able to diagnose what is stopping emails from being sent.
