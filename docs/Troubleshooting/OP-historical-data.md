# How to view historical data in on-premise

There are several ways to view historical data in FusionReactor on-premise. 

!!! warning
    Please be aware that FusionReactor on-premise only keeps a fixed default amount of transactions in memory. If the history list size gets too long or you restart your application server, then any old transactions will be removed. 


|Type       | Description     |
|--------------|-----------|
| [Request History](https://docs.fusion-reactor.com/Requests/Request-History/) | The **WebRequests History** page shows a list of the most-recently completed requests. |
| [Request Error History](https://docs.fusion-reactor.com/Requests/Request-Error-History/) |The **Request Error History** page is almost identical to the **History** page, except that it only shows transactions flagged by FusionReactor as being in error. What constitutes an error is - by default - HTTP return codes 500-599.|
| [Transactions History](https://docs.fusion-reactor.com/Transactions/History/)| The **Transactions History** page shows a list of the most-recently completed requests.  The number of historical requests stored is configurable.|
| [Transaction Error History](https://docs.fusion-reactor.com/Transactions/Error-History/) | The **Transaction Error History** page is almost identical to the **History** page, except that it only shows transactions flagged by FusionReactor as being in error. For WebRequest transactions, what constitutes an error is - by default - HTTP return codes 500-599.  
|[JDBC History](https://docs.fusion-reactor.com/JDBC/JDBC-History/) |**JDBC > JDBC History** shows a list of completed JDBC transactions.|
|[Event Snapshot History](https://docs.fusion-reactor.com/Transactions/Event-Snapshot-History/) | This page tracks the last (n) transactions which had an Event Snapshot generated and attached to the transaction.  |
| [Log Archive Viewer](https://docs.fusion-reactor.com/Logs/Log-Archive-Viewer/) | FusionReactor is capturing the instrumentation metrics, which is processed into a number of defined log files.   The log **Archive Viewer** is used to visualize the log archives which are generated by FusionReactor.
