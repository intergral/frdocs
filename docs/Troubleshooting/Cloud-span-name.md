Within search, you can specify:


|Type      | Description     |
|--------------|-----------|
| Service Name | Instance from which the trace originates.|
| Span Name | The URL or action of a transaction.|
| Tag | A label applied to a trace, for example ```txnId``` or ```status.code```. A full list of tags can be searched within the input field.|
| Min Duration | The minimum duration of a transaction. |
| Max Duration | The maximum duration of a transaction. |
|Limit | How many results you wish to view.|

You can view the trace information by clicking on the trace ID, which will open a window to the right of the screen.
